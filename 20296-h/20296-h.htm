<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The little tour which gave birth to the following
remarks, was taken immediately after the exchange
of the ratifications of a peace, necessary, but not
inglorious to my country, after a contest unexampled
in its cause, calamity, extension, vicissitudes and
glory; amidst a people who, under the influence of
a political change, hitherto unparallelled, were to be
approached as an order of beings, exhibiting a moral
and political form before but little known to themselves
and to the world, in the abrupt removal of
habits and sentiments which had silently and uninterruptedly
taken deep root in the soil of ages.</p>

<p>During a separation of ten years, we have received
very little account of this extraordinary people, which
could be relied upon. Dissimilar sensations, excited
by their principles and proceedings, ever partially
and irregularly known, have depicted unaccording
representations of them, and, in the sequel, have
exhibited rather a high-coloured, fanciful delineation,
than a plain and faithful resemblance of the original.
Many are the persons who have been thus misled.</p>

<p>These fugitive sketches, in which an attempt is
made to delineate, just as they occurred, those scenes<span class='pagenum'>iv</span>
which, to <i>my</i> mind at least, were new and interesting,
were originally penned for the private perusal of
those whom I esteem; and by their persuasion they
are now offered to the public eye. Amongst them I
must be permitted to indulge in the pride and
pleasure of enumerating William Hayley, esq. a name
familiar and dear to every elegant and polished mind.
Enlightened by his emendations, and supported by
the cherishing spirit of his approval, I approach, with
a more subdued apprehension, the tribunal of public
opinion; and to my friends I dedicate this humble
result of a short relaxation from the duties of an
anxious and laborious profession. If, by submitting
to their wishes, I have erred, I have only to offer,
that it is my first, and shall be my last offence.</p>

<h2>THE STRANGER IN FRANCE</h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Torr Abbey.&mdash;Cap of Liberty.&mdash;Anecdote of English Prejudice.&mdash;Fire
Ships.&mdash;Southampton River.&mdash;Netley Abbey.</i></p></div>


<p>It was a circumstance, which will be memorable with me,
as long as I live, and pleasant to my feelings, as often as I
recur to it, that part of my intended excursion to the Continent
was performed in the last ship of war, which, after the formal
confirmations of the peace, remained, of that vast naval armament,
which, from the heights of Torbay, for so many years,
presented to the astonished and admiring eye, a spectacle at once
of picturesque beauty, and national glory. It was the last attendant
in the train of retiring war.</p>

<p>Under the charming roof of Torr Abbey, the residence of
George Cary, esq., I passed a few days, until the Meg&aelig;ra was
ready to sail for Portsmouth, to be paid off, the commander of
which, captain Newhouse, very politely offered to convey my
companion, captain W. Cary, and myself, to that port.</p>

<p>In this beautiful spot, the gallant heroes of our navy have
often found the severe and perilous duties of the boisterous element
alleviated by attentions, which, in their splendid and cordial
display, united an elegant taste to a noble spirit of hospitality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>In the Harleian Tracts there is a short, but rather curious
account preserved of the sensation produced at the Abbey on the
5th of November, 1688, after the prince of Orange had entered
the bay with his fleet, on their passage to Brixham, where he
landed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The prince commanded captain M&mdash;&mdash; to search the lady
Cary's house, at Torr Abbey, for arms and horses. The lady
entertaining them civilly, said her husband was gone to Plymouth:
they brought from thence some horses, and a few
arms, but gave no further disturbance to the lady or her
house."</p>

<p>Throughout this embarrassing interview, the lady Cary appears
to have conducted herself with great temper, dignity and
resolution, whilst, on the other hand, the chaplain of that day,
whose opinions were not very favourable to the revolution,
unlike his present amiable and enlightened successor<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, left his
lady in the midst of her perplexities, and fled.</p>

<p>In the Abbey, I was much pleased with an interesting, though
not very ornamental trophy of the glorious victory of Aboukir.
The truckle heads of the masts of the Aquilon, a french ship of
the line, which struck to the brave captain <span class="errata" title="Lewis">Louis</span>, in that ever
memorable battle, were covered with the bonnet rouge; one of
these caps of liberty, surmounted with the british flag, has been
committed to the care of the family, by that heroic commander,
and now constitutes a temporary ornament of their dining-room.<span class='pagenum'>3</span></p>

<p>Here we laid in provision for our little voyage, without,
however, feeling the same apprehension, which agitated the
mind of a fair damsel, in the service of a lady of rank who
formerly resided in my neighbourhood, who, preparing to
attend her mistress to the Continent, and having heard from
the jolly historians of the kitchen, that the food in France
was chiefly supplied by the croaking inhabitants of the green
and standing pool, contrived, very carefully, to carry over a
piece of homebred pork, concealed in her workbag.</p>

<p>Early in the morning after we set sail, we passed through
the Needles, which saved us a very considerable circuitous
sail round the southern side of the Isle of Wight, a passage
which the late admiral Macbride first successfully attempted,
for vessels of war, in a ship of the line.</p>

<p>The vessel, in which we sailed, was a fireship; a costly
instrument of destruction, which has never been applied during
the recent war, and only once, and that unsuccessfully, during
the preceding one. We had several of them in commission,
although they are confessedly of little utility in these times,
and from the immense stores of combustibles with which they
are charged, threaten only peril to the commander and his
crew.</p>

<p>We soon after dropped anchor, and proceeded to Portsmouth,
in search of a packet for Havre-de-Grace. In the street, our
trunks were seized by the custom-house officers, whilst conveying
to the inn, but after presenting our keys, and requesting
immediate search and restoration, they were returned to
us without further annoyance. Finding that the masters of<span class='pagenum'>4</span>
the french packets were undetermined when they should sail,
we resolved upon immediately leaving this celebrated seaport,
and proceeding by water to Southampton, distant about twenty-four
miles; where, after a very unpleasant passage, from its
blowing with considerable violence soon after we left Portsmouth,
we arrived, in a little wherry, about twelve o'clock at
night, at the Vine inn, which is very conveniently situated for
passengers by the packets.</p>

<p>It will not be required of me, to attempt a minute description
of the Southampton river, at a time when I expected, with
some reason, as I afterwards understood, to sink to the bottom
of it. An observation very natural to persons in our situation
occurred to me all the way, viz. that the shores seemed to be
too far distant from each other, and that had there been less
water, the scenery would have been more delightful; an observation
which, however, the next day confirmed, when it
presented the safe and tranquil appearance of a mirror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image2.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="Southampton." title="Southampton." />
<span class="caption"><a name="Southampton" id="Southampton"></a>Southampton.</span>
</div>

<p>Finding that the packet for France was not likely to sail
immediately, we hired a boat, and proceeded down the river,
to view the beautiful ruins of Netley Abbey, in the great court
of which we dined, under the shade of aged limes, and
amidst the flappings of its feathered and restless tenantry.</p>

<p>As I am no great admirer of tedious details, I shall not
attempt an antiquarian history of this delightful spot. I shall
leave it to more circumstantial travellers, to enumerate the
genealogies of the worthies who occupied it at various eras,
and to relate, like a monumental entablature, when, where,
and how they lived and died; it will be sufficient to observe,<span class='pagenum'>5</span>
that the site of this romantic abode was granted by Henry VIII,
in 1757, to a sir William Paulet, and that after having had
many merry monks for its masters, who, no doubt, performed
their matutin&aelig; laudes and nocturn&aelig; vigili&aelig; with devout exactness;
that it is at length in the possession of Mr. Dance, who
has a very fine and picturesque estate on that side of the river,
of which these elegant ruins constitute the chief ornament.
The church still exhibits a beautiful specimen of gothic architecture,
but its tottering remains will rapidly share the fate of
the neighbouring pile, which time has prostrated on the earth,
and covered with his thickest shade of ivy.</p>

<p>Our watermen gave us a curious description of this place,
and amused us not a little with their ridiculous anacronisms.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," said one of them, contradicting the other,
"you are in the wrong, Bob, indeed you are wrong, don't
mislead them gentlemen, that there Abbey is in the true
roman style, and was built by a man they call&mdash;&mdash;, but
that's neither here nor there, I forget the name, however, its
a fine place, and universally allowed to be very old. I frequently
rows gentlefolks there, and picks up a great deal
about it."</p>

<p>On our return the tide was at its height, the sun was setting
in great glory, the sky and water seemed blended in each other,
the same red rich tint reigned throughout, the vessels at anchor
appeared suspended in the air, the spires of the churches were
tipped with the golden ray; a scene of more beauty, richness, and
tranquillity I never beheld.<span class='pagenum'>6</span></p>

Gratitude.&mdash;Make the Port of Havre.&mdash;Panic of
the Emigrants.&mdash;Landing described.&mdash;Hotel de la Paix.&mdash;Breakfast

<p>During the whole of the second day after our arrival, the town
of Southampton was in a bustle, occasioned by the flocking in
of a great number of french emigrants, who were returning to
their own country, in consequence of a mild decree, which
had been passed in their favour. The scene was truly interesting,
and the sentiment which it excited, delightful to the heart.</p>

<p>A respectable cur&eacute;, who dined in the same room with us at
our inn, was observed to eat very little; upon being pressed to enlarge
his meal, this amiable man said, with tears starting in his
eyes, "Alas! I have no appetite; a very short time will bring
me amongst the scenes of my nativity, my youth, and my
happiness, from which a remorseless revolution has parted me
for these ten long years; I shall ask for those who are dear to
me, and find them for ever gone. Those who are left will
fill my mind with the most afflicting descriptions; no, no, I
cannot eat, my good sir."</p>

<p>About noon, they had deposited their baggage upon the quay,
which formed a pile of aged portmanteaus, and battered trunks.
Parties remained to protect them, previous to their embarkation.
The sun was intensely hot, they were seated under the shade of<span class='pagenum'>7</span>
old umbrellas, which looked as if they had been the companions
of their banishment.</p>

<p>Their countenances appeared strongly marked with the pious
character of resignation, over which were to be seen a sweetness,
and corrected animation, which seemed to depict at once the
soul's delight, of returning to its native home, planted wherever
it may be, and the regret of leaving a nation, which, in the hour
of flight and misery, had nobly enrolled them in the list of
her own children, and had covered them with protection.</p>

<p>To the eternal honour of these unhappy, but excellent people,
be it said, that they have proved themselves worthy of being received
in such a sanctuary. Our country has enjoyed the benefit
of their unblemished morals, and their mild, polite, and
unassuming manners, and wherever destiny has placed them,
they have industriously relieved the national burden of their
support by diffusing the knowledge of a language, which good
sense, and common interest, should long since have considered
as a valuable branch of education.</p>

<p>To those of my friends, who exercise the sacred functions of
religion, as established in this country, I need not offer an apology,
for paying an humble tribute of common justice to these
good, and persecuted men; who, from habit, pursue a mode
of worship, a little differing in form, but terminating in the
same great and glorious centre. The enlightened liberality of
the british clergy will unite, in paying that homage to them,
which they, in my presence, have often with enthusiasm, and
rapture, offered up to the purity, and sanctity of their characters.
Many of them informed me, that they had received<span class='pagenum'>8</span>
the most serviceable favours from our clergy, administered with
equal delicacy, and munificence.</p>

<p>Amongst these groups were some females, the wives and daughters
of toulonese merchants, who left their city when lord Hood
abandoned that port. The politeness and attention, which were
paid to them by the men, were truly pleasing. It was the good
breeding of elegant habits, retaining all their softness in the midst
of adversity, sweetened with the sympathy of mutual and similar
sufferings.</p>

<p>They had finished their dinner, and were drinking their
favourite beverage of coffee. Poor wanderers! the water was
scarcely turned brown with the few grains which remained of
what they had purchased for their journey.</p>

<p>I addressed them, by telling them, that I had the happiness
of being a passenger with them, in the same vessel; they said
they were fortunate to have in their company one of that nation,
which would be dear to them as long as they lived. A genteel
middle aged woman offered to open a little parcel of fresh
coffee, which they had purchased in the town for the voyage,
and begged to make some for me. By her manner, she seemed
to wish me to consider it, more as the humble offering of gratitude,
than of politeness, or perhaps both were blended in the
offer. In the afternoon, their baggage was searched by the
revenue officers, who, on this occasion, exercised a liberal
gentleness, which gave but little trouble, and no pain. They
who brought nothing into a country but the recollection of
their miseries, were not very likely to carry much out of it, but
the remembrance of its generosity.<span class='pagenum'>9</span></p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the evening we were all on board, and
sailed with a gentle breeze down the river: we carried with
us a good stock of vegetables, which we procured fresh, from
the admirable market of Southampton. Upon going down into
the cabin, I was struck, and at first shocked, with seeing a very
aged man, stretched at his length upon pillows and clothes,
placed on the floor, attended by two clergymen, and some
women, who, in their attentions to this apparently dying old
gentleman, seemed to have forgotten their own comfortless
situation, arising from so many persons being crowded in so
small a space, for our numbers above and below amounted to
sixty. Upon inquiry, they informed me, that the person
whose appearance had so affected me, had been a clergyman
of great repute and esteem at Havre, that he was then past
the age of ninety five years, scarcely expected to survive our short
voyage, but was anxious to breathe his last in his own country.
They spoke of him, as a man who in other times, and in the
fulness of his faculties, had often from his pulpit, struck with
terror and contrition, the trembling souls of his auditors, by the
force of his exalted eloquence; who had embellished the society
in which he moved, with his elegant attainments; and who
had relieved the unhappy, with an enlarged heart and munificent
hand&mdash;A mere mass of misery, and helpless infirmities,
remained of all these noble qualities!</p>

<p>During the early part of the night, we made but little way&mdash;behind,
the dark shadowy line of land faded in mist; before
us, the moon spread a stream of silver light upon the sea. The
soft stillness of this repose of nature was broken only by the<span class='pagenum'>10</span>
rippling of the light wave against the head and sides of the
vessel, and by the whistling of the helmsman, who, with the
helm between his knees, and his arms crossed, alternately watching
the compass and the sail, thus invoked the presence of the
favouring breeze.</p>

<p>Leaving him, and some few of our unfortunate comrades,
to whom the motion of the sea was more novel than gratifying,
we descended into the steerage, (for our births in the cabin were
completely occupied by females). As we were going down the
ladder, the appearance of so many recumbent persons, faintly
distinguishable by the light of a solitary taper, reminded us of
a floating catacomb; here, crawling under a cot which contained
two very corpulent priests, upon a spare cable, wrapt
up in our own great coats, we resigned ourselves to rest.</p>

<p>The next day, without having made much progress in our little
voyage, we arose, and assembled round the companion, which
formed our breakfast table; at dinner, we were enabled to spread
a handsome table of refreshments, to which we invited all our
fellow passengers who were capable of partaking of them, many
of whom were preparing to take their scanty meal, removed
from us at the head of the vessel. For this little act of common
civility, we were afterwards abundantly repaid, by the thankfulness
of all, and the serviceable attentions of some of our
charming guests, when we landed; an instance of which I
shall afterwards have occasion to mention. The wind slackened
during the day, but in the evening it blew rather fresh, and
about nine o'clock the next morning, after a night passed
something in the same way as the former, we were awakened<span class='pagenum'>11</span>
being informed that we were within in a league of Havre; news
by no means disagreeable, after the dead dulness of a sea calm.</p>

<p>The appearance of the coast was high, rugged, and rocky;
to use a good marine expression, it looked ironbound all
along shore. To the east, upon an elevated point of land,
are two noble light houses, of very beautiful construction,
which I shall have occasion to describe hereafter.</p>

<p>At some little distance, we saw considerable flights of wild
ducks. The town and bason lie round the high western
point from the lights, below which there is a fine pebbled
beach. The quays are to the right and left within the
pier, upon the latter of which there is a small round tower.
It was not the intention of our packet captain to go within
the pier, for the purpose of saving the port-anchorage dues,
which amount to eight pounds sterling, but a government
boat came off, and ordered the vessel to hawl close up to
the quay, an order which was given in rather a peremptory
manner. Upon our turning the pier, we saw as we warped
up to the quay, an immense motley crowd, flocking down
to view us. A panic ran throughout our poor fellow passengers.
From the noise and confusion on shore, they expected
that some recent revolution had occurred, and that they were
upon the point of experiencing all the calamities, which they
had before fled from; they looked pale and agitated upon
each other, like a timid and terrified flock of sheep, when
suddenly approached by their natural enemy the wolf. It
turned out, however, that mere curiosity, excited by the display
of english colours, had assembled this formidable rabble,<span class='pagenum'>12</span>
and that the order which we received from the government
boat, was given for the purpose of compelling the captain to
incur, and consequently to pay, the anchorage dues. In a
moment we were beset by a parcel of men and boys, half
naked, and in wooden shoes, who hallooing and "sacre
dieuing" each other most unmercifully, began, without
further ceremony, to seize upon every trunk within their reach,
which they threw into their boats lying alongside.</p>

<p>By a well-timed rap upon the knuckles of one of these
marine functionaries, we prevented our luggage from sharing
the same fate. It turned out, that there was a competition
for carrying our trunks on shore, for the sake of an immoderate
premium, which they expected to receive, and which
occasioned our being assailed in this violent manner. Our
fellow-passengers were obliged to go on shore with these vociferous
watermen, who had the impudence and inhumanity to
charge them two livres each, for conveying them to the landing
steps, a short distance of about fifty yards. Upon their landing,
we were much pleased to observe that the people offered
them neither violence nor insult. They were received with a
sullen silence, and a lane was made for them to pass into the
town. The poor old clergyman who had survived the passage,
was left on board, in the care of two benevolent persons, until
he could be safely and comfortably conveyed on shore. We
soon afterwards followed our fellow-passengers in the captain's
boat, by which plan we afforded these extortioners a piece of
salutary information, very necessary to be made known to
them, that although we were english, we were not to be im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>posed
upon. I could not help thinking it rather unworthy of
our neighbours to exact from us such heavy port dues, when
our <span class="errata" title="english">own</span> demands of a similar nature, are so very trifling.
For such an <span class="errata" title="import">impost</span>, a vessel of the republic, upon its arrival
in any of the english ports, would only pay a few shillings.
Perhaps this difference will be equalized in some shape, by the
impending commercial treaty, otherwise, a considerable partial
advantage will accrue to the french from their passage packets.
Upon our landing, and entering the streets, I was a little struck
with the appearance of the women, who were habited in a
coarse red camlet jacket, with a high apron before, long flying
lappets to their caps, and were mounted upon large heavy
wooden shoes, upon each of which a worsted tuft was fixed,
in rude imitation of a rose. The appearance and clatter of
these sabots, as they are called, leave upon the mind an impression
of extreme poverty and wretchedness.</p>

<p>They are, however, more favoured than the lower order
of females in Scotland. Upon a brisk sprightly chamber-maid
entering my room one day at an inn in Glasgow, I heard
a sound which resembled the pattering of some web-footed bird,
when in the act of climbing up the miry side of a pond. I
looked down upon the feet of this bonny lassie, and found
that their only covering was procured from the mud of the
high street&mdash;adieu! to the tender eulogies of the pastoral
reed! I have never thought of a shepherdess since with
pleasure.</p>

<p>I could not help observing the ease, dexterity, and swiftness,
with which a single man conveyed all our luggage, which<span class='pagenum'>14</span>
was very heavy, to the custom-house, and afterwards to the
inn, in a wheelbarrow, which differed from ours, only in
being larger, and having two elastic handles of about nine
feet long. At the custom-house, notwithstanding what the
english papers have said of the conduct observed here, we were
very civilly treated, our boxes were only just opened, and
some of our packages were not examined at all. Away we
had them whirled, to the H&ocirc;tel de la Paix, the front of which
looks upon the wet-dock, and is embellished with a large
board, upon which is recorded, in yellow characters, as usual,
the superior advantages of this house over every other h&ocirc;tel
in Havre. Upon our arrival, we were ushered up a large
dirty staircase into a lofty room, upon the first floor, all the
windows of which were open, divided, as they always are in
France, in the middle, like folding doors; the floor was tiled,
a deal table, some common rush chairs, two very fine pier
glasses, and chandeliers to correspond, composed our motley
furniture. I found it to be a good specimen of french inns,
in general. We were followed by our hostess, the porter,
two cooks, with caps on their heads, which had once been
white, and large knives in their hands, who were succeeded
by two chamber-maids, all looking in the greatest hurry and
confusion, and all talking together, with a velocity, and vehemence,
which rendered the faculty of hearing almost a misfortune.
They appeared highly delighted to see us, talked
of our dress, sir Sidney Smith, the blockade, the noble english,
the peace, and a train of etceteras. At length we obtained
a little cessation, of which we immediately seized the advan<span class='pagenum'>15</span>tage,
by directing them to show us to our bedrooms, to procure
abundance of water hot and cold, to get us a good
breakfast as soon as possible, and to prepare a good dinner
for us at four o'clock. Amidst a peal of tongues, this clamorous
procession retired.</p>

<p>After we had performed our necessary ablutions, and had
enjoyed the luxury of fresh linen, we sat down to some
excellent coffee, accompanied with boiled milk, long, delicious
rolls, and tolerably good butter, but found no knives
upon the table; which, by the by, every traveller in France
is presumed to carry with him: having mislaid my own, I
requested the maid to bring me one. The person of this
damsel, would certainly have suffered by a comparison with
those fragrant flowers, to which young poets resemble their
beloved mistresses; as soon as I had preferred my prayer,
she very deliberately drew from her pocket a large clasp
knife, which, after she had wiped on her apron, she presented
to me, with a "voila monsieur." I received this dainty
present, with every mark of due obligation, accompanied, at
the same time, with a resolution not to use it, particularly as
my companions (for we had two other english gentlemen with
us) had directed her to bring some others to them. This
delicate instrument was as savoury as its mistress, amongst the
various fragrancies which it emitted, garlic seemed to have
the mastery.</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock we went to the hall of the municipality,
to procure our passports for the interior, and found
it crowded with people upon the same errand. We made<span class='pagenum'>16</span>
our way through them into a very handsome antiroom,
and thence, by a little further perseverance, into an inner
room, where the mayor and his officers were seated at a large
table covered with green cloth. To show what reliance is to
be placed upon the communications of english newspapers, I
shall mention the following circumstance: my companion had
left England, without a passport, owing to the repeated assurances
of both the ministerial and opposition prints, and
also of a person high in administration, that none were
necessary.</p>

<p>The first question propounded to us by the secretary was,
"citizens, where are your passports?" I had furnished myself
with one; but upon hearing this question, I was determined
not to produce it, from an apprehension that I should cover
my friend, who had none, with suspicion, so we answered,
that in England they were not required of frenchmen, and
that we had left our country with official assurances that they
would not be demanded of us here.</p>

<p>They replied to us, by reading a decree, which rigorously
required them of foreigners, entering upon the territories of
the republic, and they assured us, that this regulation was at
that moment reciprocal with every other power, and with
England in particular. The decree of course closed the
argument. We next addressed ourselves to their politeness
(forgetting that the revolution had made sad inroads upon it)
and requested them, as we had been misled, and had no other
views of visiting the country, but those of pleasure, and improvement,
that they would be pleased to grant us our passports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
for the interior. To this address, these high authorities, who
seemed not much given to "the melting mood," after making
up a physiognomy, as severe, and as <i>iron bound</i> as their coast,
laconically observed, that the laws of the republic must be
enforced, that they should write to our embassador to know
who we were, and that in the mean time they would make
out our passports for the town, the barriers of which we were
not to pass. Accordingly, a little fat gentleman, in a black
coat, filled up these official instruments, which were copied
into their books, and both signed by us; he then commenced
our "signalement," which is a regular descriptive portrait of
the head of the person who has thus the honour of sitting to
the municipal portrait painters of the d&eacute;partement de la Seine
inferieure.</p>

<p>This portrait is intended, as will be immediately anticipated,
to afford encreased facilities to all national guards, mar&eacute;chauss&eacute;es,
thief takers, &amp;c. for placing in "durance vile" the unfortunate
original, should he violate the laws.</p>

<p>The signalement is added in the margin, to the passport,
and also registered in the municipal records, which, from their
size, appeared to contain a greater number of heads and faces,
thus depicted, than any museum or gallery I ever beheld.</p>

<p>How correct the likenesses in general are, I leave to the
judgment of others, after I have informed them, that the hazle
eyes of my friend were described "yeux <span class="errata" title="bleu">bleus</span>" in this masterly
delineation.</p>

<p>If the dead march in Saul had been playing before us all
the way, we could not have marched more gravely, or rather<span class='pagenum'>18</span>
sulkily, to our inn. Before us, we had the heavy prospect
of spending about ten days in this town, not very celebrated
for either beauty, or cleanliness, until the municipality could
receive an account of us, from our embassador, who knew no
more of us than they did. The other english gentlemen were
in the same predicament.</p>

<p>However we determined to pursue the old adage, that what
is without remedy, should be without regret, and, english
like, grew very merry over a good dinner, consisting of soups,
and meat, and fowls, and fish, and vegetables (for such is the
order of a french dinner) confectionary and a desert, accompanied
with good Burgundy, and excellent Champaign. Our
misfortunes must plead our excuse, if the dinner is considered
extravagant. Uncle Toby went to sleep when he was unhappy;
we solicited consolation in another way. Our signalements
afforded us much diversion, which at length was a little
augmented by a plan which I mentioned, as likely to furnish
us with the means of our liberation. After dinner I waited
upon a young gentleman who was under the care of a very
respectable merchant, to whom I had the good fortune to have
letters of introduction. Through his means I was introduced
to Mons. de la M&mdash;&mdash;, who received me with great politeness.
In the hurry and occupations of very extensive commercial
pursuits, this amiable old gentleman had found leisure
to indulge himself in works of taste. His noble fortune
enabled him to gratify his liberal inclinations. I found him
seated in his compting-house, which, from its handsome furniture
and valuable paintings, resembled an elegant cabinet. I<span class='pagenum'>19</span>
stated the conduct of the municipality towards us, and requested
his assistance. After he had shown me his apartments,
a fine collection of drawings, by some of the first masters,
and some more excellent paintings, we parted, with an assurance
that he would immediately wait upon the mayor, who
was his friend, and had no doubt but that he should in the
course of the next day enable us to leave Havre when and
in what manner we pleased. With this agreeable piece of
intelligence, I immediately returned to the inn, where it induced
us to drink health and success to the friendly merchant
in another bottle of champaign.<span class='pagenum'>20</span></p>

<p>If Havre had been a Paradise, the feelings of restraint would
have discoloured the magic scenery, and turned the green to one
barren brown.</p>

<p>As we could relish nothing, until we had procured our release,
the first place we visited the next morning was, once
more, the residence of the municipality, where we found that
our worthy friend had previously arranged every thing to
our wishes, and upon his signing a certificate, that we were
peaceable citizens, and had no intention to overturn the republic,
our passports were made out, and upon an exchange of
a little snuff, and a few bows, we retired. The other two englishmen
had their wishes gratified, by the same lucky incident,
which had assisted us. Having changed our guineas for french
money, and as in future, when money is mentioned, it will
be in the currency of the country, it perhaps may not be unacceptable
to subjoin a table of the old, and new, and republican
coins. For every guinea of full weight, which we carried
over, we received twenty-four livres, or a louis d'or,
which is equal to twenty shillings sterling, of course we
lost one shilling upon every good guinea, and more, according
to the deficiency of weight. The course of ex<span class='pagenum'>21</span>change
and commission, with our country, I afterwards found
at Paris, to be one shilling and eight pence, in the pound sterling,
against us, but the difference will be progressively nearer
par, as the accustomed relations of commerce resume their
former habits. I was surprised to find the ancient monarchical
coin in chief circulation, and that of the republic, very confined.
Scarce a pecuniary transaction can occur, but the silent,
and eloquent medallion of the unhappy monarch, seems to remind
these bewildered people of <i>his</i> fate, and <i>their</i> past misfortunes.
Although the country is poor, all their payments are
made in cash, this is owing to the shock given by the revolution,
to individual, and consequently to paper credit.</p>

<p>To comprehend their money, it must be known, although
the french always calculate by livres, as we do by pounds sterling,
that the livre is no coin, but computation.</p>

<h5>COPPER MIXED WITH SILVER.</h5>

<p>A deux sols, or two pence french, and one penny english,
is nearly the size of our sixpence, but is copper, with a white
or silverish mixture, twelve of these make a vingt quatre sols
piece, or one shilling english.</p>

<p>They have also another small piece of nearly the same size
and colour, but not so white, and rather thinner, which is one
sol and a half, three halfpence french, or three farthings
english.</p>

<h5>COPPER.</h5>

<p>A sol is like our halfpenny, value one penny french, or a
halfpenny english, twenty-four of these make an english shilling.</p>

<p>A deux liard piece is half a sol french, or a farthing english.</p>

<p>A liard is a farthing french, and of the value of half a farthing
english.</p>

<h5>NEW COIN.</h5>

<p>A thirty sols piece, is a very beautiful and convenient coin,
worth one shilling and three pence english, having a good impression
of the late king's head on one side, and the goddess of
liberty on the other; it was struck in the early part of the
revolution.</p>


<h4>REPUBLICAN COIN.</h4>

<h5>SILVER.</h5>

<p>A fifteen sols piece is half of the above and very convenient.<span class='pagenum'>23</span></p>

<h5>COPPER.</h5>

<p>A six liard is a bit of copper composition, such as the fine
cannon are made of, and is worth three sols french, or a halfpenny,
and a farthing english.</p>

<p>A cinq centimes is worth a halfpenny and half a farthing
english.</p>

<p>The centimes are of the value of half farthings, five of which
are equal to the last coin, they are very small and neat.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<p>An early knowledge of these coins, is very necessary to a
stranger, on account of the dishonest advantages which french
tradesmen take of their english customers.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>To return to my narrative: finding ourselves at liberty to
pursue our route, we went from the municipality to the bureau
des diligences, and secured our places in the voiture to Rouen,
for the next day.</p>

<p>After this necessary arrangement, we proceeded to view the
town, which is composed of long and narrow streets. The
fronts of the houses, which are lofty, are deformed by the
spaces between the naked intersections of the frame work being
filled up with mortar, which gives them an appearance of
being very heavy, and very mean.</p>

<p>The commerce formerly carried on at Havre, was very extensive.
There is here also large manufactories for lace. The
theatre is very spacious, well arranged, and as far as we could
judge by day-light, handsomely decorated. The players did<span class='pagenum'>24</span>
not perform during our stay. In the vegetable market place,
which was much crowded, and large, we saw at this season of the
year abundance of fine apples, as fresh in appearance as when
they were first plucked from the tree.</p>

<p>In our way there we were accosted by a little ragged beggar
boy, who addressed himself to our compassionate dispositions,
by the appellation of "tr&egrave;s charitable citoyen," but finding we
gave nothing, he immediately changed it to "mon ch&egrave;re tr&egrave;s
charitable monsieur."</p>

<p>The strange uncouth expression of citoyen is generally laid
aside, except amongst the immediate officers under government,
in their official communications, who, however, renounce it in
private, for the more civilized title of "monsieur."</p>

<p>The principal church is a fine handsome building, and had
been opened for worship, the Sunday before we arrived: On
that day the bell of the Sabbath first sounded, during ten years
of revolution, infidelity, and bloodshed!!!</p>

<p>The royal arms are every where removed. They formerly
constituted a very beautiful ornament over the door of the hotel
of the present prefect, at the head of the market place, but they
have been rudely beaten out by battle axes, and replaced by
rude republican emblems, which every where (I speak of them
as a decoration) seem to disfigure the buildings which bear
them. When I made this remark, I must, however, candidly
confess, that my mind very cordially accompanied my eye,
and that natural sentiment mingled with the observation. The
quays, piers, and arsenal are very fine, they, together with
the docks, for small ships of war and merchandize, were con<span class='pagenum'>25</span>structed
under the auspices of Lewis XIV, with whom this port
was a great favourite.</p>

<p>We saw several groups of men at work in heavy chains. They
were soldiers who had offended. They are dressed in <i>red</i> jackets
and trowsers, which are supposed to increase their disgrace, on account
of its being the regimental colour of their old enemy, the
english. When my companion, who wore his regimentals,
passed them, they all moved their caps to him with great
respect.</p>

<p>The town, and consequently the commerce of Rouen, was
most successfully blockaded, for near four years, by british
commanders, during the late war, and particularly by sir Sidney
Smith. It was here, when endeavouring to cut out a vessel,
which in point of value, and consideration was unworthy of such
an exposure, that this great hero, and distinguished being was
made a prisoner of war. The inhabitants, who never speak of
him, but with emotions of terror, consider this event as the
rash result of a wager conceived over wine. Those who know
the character of sir Sidney, will not impute to him such an act
of <i>idle</i> temerity. No doubt he considered the object, as included
in his duty, and it is only to be lamented, that during two lingering
years of rigorous, and cruel confinement, in the dungeons
of the unhappy sovereign, his country was bereaved of the
assistances of her immortal champion, who, in a future season,
upon the shores of Acre, so nobly filled up the gloomy chasm of
suspended services, by exploits, which to be believed, must not
be <i>adequately</i> described, and who revenged, by an act of unrivalled
glory, the long endurance of sufferings, and indignities<span class='pagenum'>26</span>
hateful to the magnanimous spirit of modern warfare, and unknown
to it, until displayed within the walls of a prussian
dungeon<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall hereafter have occasion to mention this extraordinary
character, when I speak of his escape from the Temple, the real
circumstances attending which are but little known, and which
I received from an authority upon which the reader may rely.</p>

<p>This town is not unknown to history. At the celebrated
siege of it, in the time of Catharine de Medicis, that execrable
princess, distinguished herself by her personal intrepidity. It is
said, that she landed here, in a galley, bearing the device of the
sun, with these words in greek, "I bring light, and fine weather"&mdash;a
motto which ill corresponded with her conduct.</p>

<p>With great courage, such as seldom associates with cruel, and
ferocious tyrants, she here on horseback, at the head of her
army, exposed herself to the fire of the cannon, like the most
veteran soldiers, and betrayed no symptoms of fear, although
the bullets flew about her in all directions. When desired by the
duke of Guise, and the constable de Montmorenci not to expose
her person so much, the brave, but sanguinary Catharine replied,
"Have I not more to lose than you, and do you think I have
not as much courage?"</p>

<p>The walk, through la ville de Sandwiche, to the light houses,
which are about two miles from Havre, is very pleasing. The
path lay through flax and clover fields. In this part of the
country, the farmers practise an excellent plan of rural economy,<span class='pagenum'>27</span>
which is also used in Dorsetshire, and some few other counties, of
confining their cattle by a string to a spot of pasture, until they
have completely cleared it.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the hill, ascending to the cliffs, are several very elegant
chateaus and gardens, belonging to the principal inhabitants of
the town.</p>

<p>Monsieur B&mdash;&mdash;, the prefect de marine, has a beautiful residence
here. We were accidentally stopping at his gate, which
was open, to view the enchanting prospects, which it presented
to us, when the polite owner observed us, and with that amiableness,
and civility, which still distinguish the descendants of
the ancient families of rank in France, of which he is one, requested
us to enter, and walked with us round his grounds,
which were disposed with great taste. He afterwards conducted
us to his elegant house, and gave us dried fruit, and excellent
burgundy, after which we walked round the village to the light
houses. From him we learnt, that the farmers here, as in
England, were very respectable, and had amassed considerable
wealth during the war. The approach to the light houses,
through a row of elms, is very pleasant; they stand upon an
immense high perpendicular cliff, and are lofty square buildings,
composed of fine light brown free stone, the entrance is handsome,
over which there is a good room, containing four high
windows, and a lodging room for the people, who have the care
of the light, the glass chamber of which we reached, after ascending
to a considerable height, by a curious spiral stone stair
case. The lantern is composed, of ninety immense reflecting
lamps, which are capable of being raised or depressed with great<span class='pagenum'>28</span>
ease by means of an iron windlass. This large lustre, is surrounded
with plates of the thickest french glass, fixed in squares
of iron, and discharges a prodigious light, in dark nights. A
furnace of coal, was formerly used, but this has been judiciously
superseded by the present invention. Round the lantern,
is a gallery with an iron balustrade, the view from this
elevation upon the beach, the entrance of the Seine, Honfleur
(where our Henry III is said to have fought the french armies,
and to have distinguished himself by his valour) the distant hills
of Lower Normandy, and the ocean, is truly grand. It
brought to my mind that beautiful description of Shakspeare&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The murmuring surge</span>
<span class="i0">That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,</span>
<span class="i0">Cannot be heard so high: I'll look no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight</span>
<span class="i0">Topple down headlong.</span>
</div>

<p>We did not visit the other tower, as it was uniform with
this. The woman who has the charge of the light, was very
good humoured, and very talkative, she seemed delighted to
show us every thing, and said she preferred seeing englishmen <i>in</i>
her tower as friends, to the view she frequently had of them
<i>from</i> it as enemies, alluding to the long, and masterly blockade
of this port by a squadron of english frigates. She carried us to
her little museum, as she called it, where she had arranged,
very neatly, a considerable collection of fossils, shells, and petrefactions.
Here she showed us with great animation, two<span class='pagenum'>29</span>
british cannon balls, which during the blockade, had very nearly
rendered her husband and herself, as cold and as silent as any
of the petrefactions in her collection. In this little cabinet was
her bed, where amidst the war of winds and waves, she told us
she slept as sound as a <i>consul</i>.</p>

<p>In the basins of Havre, we saw several rafts, once so much
talked of, constructed for the real, or ostensible purpose of conveying
the invading legions of France, to the shores of Great
Britain. I expected to have seen an immense floating platform,
but the vessels which we saw, were made like brigs of an unusual
breadth, with two low masts. The sincerity of this project
has been much disputed, but that the french government
expended considerable sums upon the scheme, I have no
doubt.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention, the admirable mode, which
they have here, and in most parts of France, of constructing
their carts. They are placed upon very high wheels, the
load is generally arranged so as to create an equipoise, and
is raised by an axle, fastened near the shafts. I was informed
by a merchant, that a single horse can draw with ease
thirty-six hundred weight, in one of these carts. These animals
have a formidable appearance, owing to a strange
custom which the french have, of covering the collar, with
an entire sheep's skin, which gives them the appearance of
having an enormous shaggy mane.</p>

<p>At night, we settled our bills which amounted to forty
livres each. A considerable charge in this country, but we
had lived well, and had not thought it worth our while,<span class='pagenum'>30</span>
on account of the probable shortness of our stay, to bargain
for our lodging, and board, a plan generally proper
to be used by those, who mean to remain for some length
of time, in any place in France.</p>

<p>Before I proceed on my journey, I must beg leave to
present a very cheap mode of travelling to Paris, from Havre,
to those who have more time at their command than I had. It
was given to me by a respectable gentleman, and an old traveller.</p>

<p>This progress, however, is tedious and uncertain.</p>

<p>At day-break we seated ourselves in the diligence. All the
carriages of this description have the appearance of being the
result of the earliest efforts in the art of coach building. A
more uncouth clumsy machine can scarcely be imagined. In
the front is a cabriolet fixed to the body of the coach, for the
accommodation of three passengers, who are protected from
the rain above, by the projecting roof of the coach, and in<span class='pagenum'>32</span>
front by two heavy curtains of leather, well oiled, and smelling
somewhat offensively, fastened to the roof. The inside, which
is capacious, and lofty, and will hold six people with great
comfort, is lined with leather padded, and surrounded with
little pockets, in which the travellers deposit their bread, snuff,
night caps, and pocket handkerchiefs, which generally enjoy
each others company in the same delicate depositary. From
the roof depends a large net work, which is generally crouded
with hats, swords, and band boxes, the whole is convenient,
and when all parties are seated and arranged, the accommodations
are by no means unpleasant.</p>

<p>Upon the roof, on the outside, is the imperial, which is
generally filled with six or seven persons more, and a heap of
luggage, which latter also occupies the basket, and generally
presents a pile, half as high again as the coach, which is secured
by ropes and chains, tightened by a large iron windlass,
which also constitutes another appendage of this moving mass.
The body of the carriage rests upon large thongs of leather,
fastened to heavy blocks of wood, instead of springs, and the
whole is drawn by seven horses. The three first are fastened
to the cross bar, the rest are in pairs, all in rope harness
and tackling. The near horse of the three first, is mounted
by the postilion, in his great jack boots, which are always
placed, with much ceremony, like two tubs, on the right
side of his Rosinante, just before he ascends. These curious
protectors of his legs, are composed of wood, and iron hoops,
softened within by stuffing, and give him all the dignity of
riding in a pair of upright portmanteaus. With a long lash<span class='pagenum'>33</span>
whip in his hand, a dirty night cap and an old cocked hat upon
his head, hallooing alternately "&agrave; gauche, &agrave; droit," and a few
occasional sacre dieus, which seem always properly applied,
and perfectly understood, the merry postilion drives along his
cattle. I must not fail to do justice to the scientific skill with
which he manages on horseback, his long and heavy coach
whip; with this commanding instrument, he can reanimate
by a touch, each halting muscle of his lagging animals, can
cut off an annoying fly, and with the loud cracking of its
thong, he announces, upon his entrance into a town, the approach
of his heavy, and clattering cavalcade. Each of these
diligences is provided with a conducteur, who rides upon the
imperial, and is responsible throughout the journey, for the
comfort of the passengers and safety of the luggage. For his
trouble the passenger pays him only thirty sols for himself, and
fifteen more for the different postillions, to be divided amongst
them, for these the donor is thanked with a low bow, and many
"bien oblig&eacute;s," in the name of himself and his contented
comrades.</p>

<p>Our companions proved to be some of our old friends the
emigrants, who had thrown aside their marine dishabille, and
displayed the appearance of gentlemen. We were much
pleased with again meeting each other. Their conversation
upon the road was very interesting, it was filled with sincere
regret for the afflictions of their country, and with expressions
of love and gratitude towards the english. They told us many
little tales of politeness, and humanity which they had received
from my countrymen in the various towns, where their destiny<span class='pagenum'>34</span>
had placed them. One displayed, with amiable pride, a snuff
box, which he had received as a parting token of esteem,
another a pocket book, and each was the bearer of some little
affectionate proof of merit, good conduct, or friendship.</p>

<p>One of these gentlemen, the abb&egrave; de l'H&mdash;&mdash;, whose face
was full of expression, tinctured with much grief, and attendant
<span class="correction" title="indispostion">indisposition</span>, with a manner, and in a tone, which were truly
affecting, concluded a little narrative of some kindness which
he had received, by saying, "if the english and my country
are not friends, it shall not be for want of my prayers. I
fled from France without tears, for the preservation of my
life, but when I left England, I confess it, I could not help
shedding some." They did not disgrace the generous abb&egrave;&mdash;such
a nation was worthy of such feelings.</p>

<p>Our horses were of the norman breed, small, stout, short,
and full of spirit, and to the honour of those who have the
care of them, in excellent condition. I was surprised to see
these little animals running away with our cumbrous machine,
at the rate of six or seven miles an hour.</p>

<p>We traced the desolating hand of the revolution as soon as
we ascended the first hill.</p>

<p>Our road lay through a charming country. Upon the sides
of its acclivities, surrounded by the most romantic scenery of
woods and corn fields, we saw ruined convents, and roofless
village churches, through the shattered casements of which the
wind had free admission.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at a neat town called Bolbec, seven leagues
from Havre, where we had excellent coffee, butter, and rolls.<span class='pagenum'>35</span>
All the household of our inn looked clean, happy, and
sprightly.</p>

<p>This is the principal town of the province of Caux, the
women of which dress their heads in a very peculiar, and in
my humble opinion, unbecoming manner. I made a hasty
sketch of one of them who entered the yard of the inn with
apples for sale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">

<span class="caption"><a name="A_Woman_of_the_province" id="A_Woman_of_the_province"></a>A Woman of the province of Caux in Normandy.</span>
</div>

<p>Such a promontory of cap and lace I never before beheld.
She had been at a village marriage that morning, and was
bedecked in all her finery. The people of this province are
industrious and rich, and consequently respectable. At the
theatre at Rouen I afterwards saw, in one of the front boxes,
a lady from this country, dressed after its fashion; the effect
was so singular that it immediately induced me to distinguish
her, from the rest of the audience, but her appearance seemed
to excite no curiosity with any other person. Our breakfast
cost us each fifteen sous, to which may be added two sols
more, for the maids, who waited upon us with cheerful smiles,
and habited in the full cushvois costume, and which also
entitled us to kisses and curtsies. I beg leave to oppose our
breakfast charge to the rumours which prevailed in England,
that this part of France was then in a state of famine. From
this town, the road was beautifully lined with beech, chesnut,
and apple trees. The rich yellow of the rape seed which
overspread the surface of many of the fields on each side,
was very animating to the eye. From this vegetable the
country people express oil, and of the pulp of it make cakes,
which the norman horses will fatten upon. We had an early<span class='pagenum'>36</span>
dinner at Ivetot, five leagues distant from Bolbec. In ancient
periods this miserable town was once the capital of a separate
kingdom. In our dining room were three beds, or rather
we dined in the bed room. I use the former expression out
of compliment to the pride of our little host, who replied
with some loftiness to one of our companions, who, upon
entering the room, and seeing so many accommodations for
repose, exclaimed, with the sharpness of appetite, "my good
host, we want to eat, and not to sleep;" "gentlemen," said
our mortified little maitre d'h&ocirc;tel, "this chamber is the dining
room, and it is thought a very good one." From its appearance
I should have believed him, had he sworn that it
was the state room of the palace of this ancient principality,
of which this wretched town was once the capital. It reminded
me of an anecdote related by an ancient english lady
of fashion, when she first paid her respects to James I, soon
after his accession to the crown of England. She mentions
in her memoir, that his royal drawing room was so very
dirty, that after the levee she was obliged to recur to her comb
for relief. In plain truth, James I and his court were lousy.</p>

<p>Our master of the house was both cook and waiter. At
dinner, amongst several other dishes, we had some stewed beef,
I requested to be favoured with a little mustard, our host very
solemnly replied, "I am very sorry, citizen, but I have none,
if you had been fortunate enough to have been here about
three weeks since, you might have had some." It was
more than I wished, so I ate my beef very contentedly without
it. With our desert we had a species of cake called brioche,<span class='pagenum'>37</span>
composed of egg, flour, and water; it is in high estimation in
France.</p>

<p>It was in this town <i>only</i> that I saw a specimen of that
forlorn wretchedness and importunity, which have been said
to constitute the general nuisance of this country.</p>

<p>In the shop of a brazier here, was exposed, a new leaden
crucifix, about two feet and a half high, for sale; it had been
cast preparatory to the reinauguration of the archbishop of
Rouen, which was to take place upon the next Sunday week,
in the great cathedral of that city.</p>

<p>In consequence of the restoration of religion, the beggars,
who have in general considerable cleverness, and know how
to turn new circumstances to advantage, had just learnt a fresh
mode of soliciting money, by repeating the Lord's Prayer in
French and Latin. We were treated with this sort of importunate
piety for near a mile, after we left Ivetot.</p>

<p>I have before mentioned, that the barbarous jargon of the
revolution is rapidly passing away. It is only here and there,
that its slimy track remains. The time is not very distant
when Frenchmen wished to be known by the name of
Jacobins; it is now become an appellation of reproach, even
amongst the surviving aborigines of the revolution. As an instance
of it, a naval officer of rank and intelligence, who joined
us at Ivetot, informed us, that he had occasion, upon some
matters of business, to meet Santerre a few days before; that
inhuman and vulgar revolutionist, who commanded the national
guards when they surrounded the scaffold during the execution
of their monarch. In the course of their conversation,<span class='pagenum'>38</span>
Santerre, speaking of a third person, exclaimed, "I cannot
bear that man; he is a Jacobin." Let all true revolutionary
republicans cry out, Bravo! at this.</p>

<p>This miscreant lives unnoticed, in a little village near Paris,
upon a slender income, which he has made in trade, not in
the <i>trade of blood</i>; for it appears that Robespierre was not a
very liberal patron of his servants. He kept his blood-hounds
lean, and keen, and poorly fed them with the rankest offal.</p>

<p>After a dusty journey, through a very rich and picturesque
country, of near eighty miles, we entered the beautiful boulevards<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of Rouen, about seven o'clock in the evening, which
embowered us from the sun. Their shade was delicious. I
think them finer than those of Paris. The noble elms, which
compose them in four stately rows, are all nearly of the same
height. Judge of my surprise&mdash;Upon our rapidly turning the
corner of a street, as we entered the city, I suddenly found
coach, horses and all, in the aisle of an ancient catholic church.
The gates were closed upon us, and in a moment from the
busy buzzing of the streets, we were translated into the silence
of shattered tombs, and the gloom of cloisters: the only
light which shone upon us, issued through fragments of
stained glass, and the apertures which were formerly filled
with it.</p>

<p>My surprise, however, was soon quieted, by being informed,
that this church, having devolved to the nation as its property,
by force of a revolutionary decree, had been afterwards sold
for stables, to one of the owners of the Rouen diligences.<span class='pagenum'>39</span></p>

<p>An old unsaleable cabriolet occupied the place of the altar;
and the horses were very quietly eating their oats in the
sacristy!!</p>

<p>At the Bureau, we paid twelve livres and a half for our
places and luggage from Havre to this town.<span class='pagenum'>40</span></p>

<p>Having collected together all our luggage, and seen it
safely lodged in a porter's wheelbarrow, Captain C. and I
bade adieu to our fellow travellers, and to these solemn and
unsuitable habitations of ostlers and horses, and proceeded
through several narrow streets, lined with lofty houses, the shops
of which were all open, and the shopkeepers, chiefly women,
looked respectable and sprightly, with gay bouquets in their
bosoms, to the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe; it is a fine inn, to which
we had been recommended at Havre, kept by Madame F&mdash;&mdash;,
who, with much politeness, and many captivating movements,
dressed &agrave;-la-Grec, with immense golden earrings, approached
us, and gave us a little piece of information, not very pleasant
to travellers somewhat discoloured by the dust of a long and
sultry day's journey, who wanted comfortable rooms, fresh
linen, a little coffee, and a good night's repose: her information
was, that her house was completely full, but that she would
send to an upholsterer to fit up two beds for us, in a very
neat room, which she had just papered and furnished, opposite
to the porter's lodge (all the great inns and respectable townhouses
in France have great gates, and a porter's lodge, at the<span class='pagenum'>41</span>
entrance.) As we wished to have three rooms, we told her,
we were friends of Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, (the principal merchants of
Rouen). She said, they were very amiable men, and were
pleased to <i>send all their friends to her house</i> (a little french fib of
Madame F&mdash;&mdash;'s, by the by, as will appear hereafter); and
she was truly sorry that she could not accommodate us better.
We looked into the room, which also looked into the street,
was exposed to all its noise, and very small. So we made
our bows to Madame F&mdash;&mdash;, and proceeded with our wheelbarrow
to the H&ocirc;tel de Poitiers&mdash;a rival house. It is situated
in the beautiful boulevards, which I have mentioned, and is
part of a row of fine stonebuilt houses. Upon our ringing the
bell, Madame P&mdash;&mdash; presented herself. We told her, we were
just arrived at Rouen, that we had the honour of being known
to Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, and should be happy to be placed under her
roof, and wished to have two lodging rooms and a sitting
room to ourselves. Madame P&mdash;&mdash;, who possessed that sort
of good and generous heart, which nature, for its better preservation,
had lodged in a comfortable envelope of comely
plumpness, observed, that Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash; were gentlemen of
great respectability, were her patrons, and always <i>sent their</i>
friends to <i>her</i> house (a point upon which these rival dames were
at issue, but the truth was with Madame P&mdash;&mdash;); that she
would do all in her power to make us happy; but at present,
on account of her house being very crowded, she could only
offer us two bedrooms. We were too tired to think of any
further peregrinations of discovery; so we entered our bed-rooms,
which, like most of the chambers in France, had brick<span class='pagenum'>42</span>
floors without any carpetting; they were, however, clean; and,
after ordering a good fire in one of them (for the sudden and
unusual frost, which, in the beginning of summer, committed
so much ravage throughout Europe, commenced the day we had
first the honour of seeing Madame P&mdash;&mdash;); and, after enjoying
those comforts which weary wanderers require, we mounted
our lofty beds, and went to rest.</p>

<p>The next day we presented our letter, and ourselves, to
Madame G&mdash;&mdash;, the amiable mother of the gentlemen I have
mentioned. She received us with great politeness, and immediately
arranged a dinner party for us, for that day. It being
rather early in the morning, we were admitted into her
chamber, a common custom of receiving early visits in France.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock we saw a splendid procession of all
the military and civil authorities to the h&ocirc;tel<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the prefect,
which was opposite to our inn.</p>

<p>The object of this cavalcade was to congratulate the archbishop
of Rouen (who was then upon a visit to the prefect,
until his own palace was ready to receive him) on his elevation
to the see.</p>

<p>This spectacle displayed the interference of God, in thus
making the former enemies of his worship pay homage to his
ministers, after a long reign of atheism and persecution.</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock, which is the hour of parade throughout
the republic, we went to the Champ de Mars, and saw
a review of the 20th regiment of chasseurs, under the com<span class='pagenum'>43</span>mand
of generals St. Hiliare and Ruffin, who, as well as
the regiment, had particularly distinguished themselves at
Marengo.</p>

<p>The men were richly appointed, and in general well
mounted. They all wore mustachios. They were just arrived
from Amiens, where, as a mark of honour, they had been
quartered during the negotiation.</p>

<p>The officers were superbly attired. St. Hiliare is a young
man, and in person much resembles his patron and friend, the
first consul; and, they say, in abilities also.</p>

<p>Some of the horses were of a dissimilar size and colour, which
had a bad effect; but I was informed, upon making the remark,
that they had lost many in battle, and had not had
time properly to replace them. They were all strong and
fiery, and went through their evolutions with surprising
swiftness.</p>

<p>At dinner our party was very agreeable. Next to me sat a
little abb&egrave;, who appeared to be in years, but full of vivacity,
and seemed to be much esteemed by every person present.
During the <i>time of terrour</i> (as the French emphatically call the
gloomy reign of Robespierre) the blood of this good man, who,
from his wealth, piety, and munificence, possessed considerable
influence in Rouen, was sought after with keen pursuit.
Madame G&mdash;&mdash; was the saviour of his life, by concealing him,
previous to her own imprisonment, for two years, in different
cellars, under her house, which she rendered as warm and as
comfortable as circumstances, and the nature of the concealment,
would allow. In one of these cells of humane secresy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
this worthy man has often eaten his solitary and agitated meal,
whilst the soldiers of the tyrant, who were quartered upon
his protectress, were carousing in the kitchen immediately above
him.</p>

<p>Soon after our coffee, which, in this country, immediately
succeeds the dinner, we went to view the bridge of boats,
so celebrated in history. This curious structure was contrived
by an augustine friar named Michael Bougeois, it is composed
of timber, regularly paved, in squares which contain the <span class="errata" title="stories">stones</span>,
and is 1000<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> feet in length; it commences from the middle
of the quay of Rouen, and reaches over to the Fauxbourg
of St. Sever, and carries on the communication with the
country which lies south of the city. It was begun in the year
1626, below it are the ruins of the fine bridge of 13 arches,
built by the empress Maud, daughter of Henry I of England.
This ingenious fabric rests upon 19 immense barges, which
rise and fall with the flowing and subsiding of the tide.
When vessels have occasion to pass it, a portion of the platform
sufficient to admit their passage is raised, and rolled over the other
part. In the winter, when any danger is apprehended from
the large flakes of ice, which float down the river, the whole is
taken to pieces in an hour. The expense of keeping it in
repair is estimated at 10000 livres, or 400 pounds sterling per
annum, and is defrayed by government, it being the highroad
to Picardy. Upon the whole, although this bridge is so
much admired, I must confess it appeared to me a heavy per<span class='pagenum'>45</span>formance,
unsuitable to the wealth, and splendour of the city
of Rouen, and below the taste and ingenuity of modern times.
A handsome light stone structure, with a centre arch covered
with a drawbridge, for the passage of vessels of considerable
burden, or a lofty flying iron bridge, would be less expensive,
more safe, and much more ornamental.</p>

<p>The view from this bridge up the Seine, upon the islands
below mount St. Catharine, is quite enchanting. Upon the
quay, although it was Sunday, a vast number of people were
dancing, drinking, and attending shows and lotteries. Here
were people of various nations, parading up and down in the
habits and dresses of their respective countries, which produced
quite the effect of a masquerade. The river Seine is so deep at
this place, that ships of three hundred tons burden are moored
close to the quay, and make a very fine appearance. The
exchange for the merchants is parallel with the centre of the
quay, and is a long paved building of about 400 feet in length,
open at top, having a handsome iron balustrade, and seats
towards the Seine, and a high stone wall towards the town.
Over all the great gates of the city, is written, in large characters,
"Liberty, Equality, Humanity, Fraternity or Death:"
the last two words have been painted over, but are still faintly
legible.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to the french opera, which was
very crowded. The boxes were adorned with genteel people, and
many beautiful young women. The theatre is very large, elegant,
and handsome, and the players were good. I was struck with
the ridiculous antics, and gestures of the chef in the orchestra, a<span class='pagenum'>46</span>
man whose office it is to beat time to the musicians. In the
municipality box which was in the centre, lined with green silk,
and gold, were two fine young women who appeared to be
ladies of fashion, and consequence; they were dressed after
the antique, in an attire which, for lightness, and scantiness I
never saw equalled, till I saw it surpassed at Paris. They appeared
to be clothed only in jewels, and a little muslin, very
gracefully disposed, the latter, to borrow a beautiful expression,
had the appearance of "woven air."&mdash;From emotions of gratitude,
for the captivating display which they made, I could
not help offering a few fervent wishes, that the light of the
next day might find them preserved from the dreaded consequences
of a very bitter cold night.</p>

<p>Rouen, upon the whole, is a fine city, very large, and populous.
It was formerly the capital of the kingdom of Normandy.
It stands upon a plain, screened on three sides, by
high, and picturesque mountains. It is near two leagues in
compass, exclusive of the fauxbourgs of St. Severs, Cauchoise,
Bouveul, St. Hiliare, Martainville and Beauvisme. Its commerce
was very celebrated, and is returning with great rapidity.
Most of the fine buildings in this city, and its environs are
Anglo-Norman antiquities, and were founded by the English
before they left Normandy.</p>

<p>The cathedral is a grand, and awful pile of gothic architecture,
built by our William the Conqueror. It has two towers,
one of which, is surmounted by a wooden spire covered with
lead, and is of the prodigious height of 395 french feet, the
other is 236 feet high.<span class='pagenum'>47</span></p>

<p>The additional wooden spire, and the inequality of the towers
produce rather an unfavourable effect. During the revolution,
this august edifice was converted into a sulphur and gunpowder
manufactory, by which impious prostitution, the pillars
are defaced, and broken, and the whole is blackened, and
dingy.</p>

<p>The costly cenotaphs of white marble, enriched with valuable
ornaments containing the hearts of our Henry III, and
Richard I, kings of England, and dukes of Normandy, which
were formerly placed on each side of the grand altarpiece, were
removed during the revolution.</p>

<p>The altarpiece is very fine. Grand preparations were making
for the inauguration of the archbishop, which was to take
place the following Sunday. There were not many people
at mass; those who were present, appeared to be chiefly composed
of old women, and young children. Over the charity box
fastened to one of the pillars was a board upon which was
written in large letters "Hospices reconnoissance et prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;
&agrave; l'homme g&eacute;n&eacute;reux et sensible." I saw few people affected
by this benedictory appeal. I next visited the church of
St. Ouens, which is not so large as the cathedral, but surpasses
that, and every other sacred edifice I ever beheld, in point
of elegance. This graceful pile, has also had its share of
sufferings, during the reign of revolutionary barbarism. Its
chaste, and elegant pillars, have been violated by the smoke of
sulphur and wood; and in many places, present to the distressed
eye, chasms, produced by massy forges, which were erected
against them, for casting ball. The costly railing of brass, gilt,<span class='pagenum'>48</span>
which half surrounded the altar, has been torn up, and melted
into cannon. The large circular stained window over the
entrance called La Rose du Portail is very beautiful, and
wholly unimpaired. The organs in all the churches are broken
and useless. They experienced this fate, in consequence of
their having been considered as fanatical instruments during the
time of terrour. The fine organ of St. Ouens is in this predicament,
and will require much cost to repair it<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot help admiring the good sense which in all the
churches of France is displayed, by placing the organ upon
a gallery over the grand entrance, by which the spectator has
an uninterrupted view, and commands the whole length of
the interior building. In the English cathedrals, it is always
placed midway between the choir and church, by which,
this desired effect is lost.&mdash;St. Ouens is now open for worship.</p>

<p>In spite of all the devastations of atheistic Vandalism, this
exquisite building, like the holy cause to which it is consecrated,
having withstood the assailing storm, and elevating its
meek, but magnificent head above its enemies, is mildly ready
to receive them into her bosom, still disfigured with the traces
of blind and barbarous ferocity.</p>

<p>Behind the altar, I met the celebrated prince of Waldec.
He, who possessed of royal honours, and ample domains, revolted
in the day of battle, from his imperial master, and joined
the victorious and pursuing foe. I beheld him in a shaded
corner of one of the cloisters of St. Ouens, in poor attire,<span class='pagenum'>49</span>
with an old umbrella under his arm, scantily provided for,
and scarcely noticed by his <i>new</i> friends. A melancholy, but
just example of the rewards due to treachery and desertion.</p>

<p>I have described these churches only generally, it cannot
be expected of me to enter into an elaborate history of them,
or of any other public edifices. The detail, if attempted, might
prove dull, and is altogether incompatible with the limited
time, and nature of my excursion.</p>

<p>After we left St. Ouens, we visited the Square aux Vaux,
where the celebrated heroine of Lorrain, Joan d'Arc, commonly
called the Maid of Orleans was cruelly burnt at the
stake, for a pretended sorceress, but in fact to gratify the barbarous
revenge of the duke of Bedford, the then regent of
France; because after signal successes, she conducted her
sovereign, Charles, in safety, to Rheims, where he was crowned,
and obtained decisive victories over the English arms. We
here saw the statue erected by the French, to the memory
of this remarkable woman, which as an object of sculpture
seems to possess very little worthy of notice.<span class='pagenum'>50</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>First Consul's Advertisement.&mdash;Something ridiculous.&mdash;Eggs.&mdash;Criminal
Military Tribunal.&mdash;French Female Confidence.&mdash;Town
House.&mdash;Convent of Jesuits.&mdash;Guillotine.&mdash;Governor W&mdash;&mdash;.</i></p></div>


<p>Upon looking up against the corner wall of a street, surrounded
by particoloured advertisements of quack medicines,
wonderful cures, new invented essences, judgments of cassation,
rewards for robbers, and bills of the opera, I beheld
Bonaparte's address to the people of France, to elect him first
consul for life. I took it for granted that the spanish proverb
of "tell me with whom you are, and I will tell you what
you are," was not to be applied in this instance, on account
of the company in which the <i>Consular application</i>, by a mere
fortuitous coincidence, happened to be placed.</p>

<p>A circumstance occurred at this time, respecting this election,
which was rather ridiculous, and excited considerable mirth
at Paris. Upon the first appearance of the election book of
the first consul, in one of the departments, some wag, instead
of subscribing his name, immediately under the title of the
page, "shall Napoleone Bonaparte be first consul for life?"
wrote the following words, "I can't tell."</p>

<p>This trifling affair affords rather a favourable impression of
the mildness of that government, which could inspire sufficient
confidence to hazard such a stroke of pleasantry. It reached
Mal Maison with great speed, but is said to have occasioned<span class='pagenum'>51</span>
no other sensation there, than a little merriment. Carnot's
bold negative was a little talked of, but as it was solitary, it
was considered harmless. To the love of finery which the
french still retain to a certain degree, I could alone attribute
the gay appearance of the eggs in the market, upon which had
been bestowed a very smart stain of lilac colour. The effect
was so singular that I could not help noting it down.</p>

<p>On the third day after our arrival in this city, we attended
the trial of a man who belonged to one of the banditti which
infest the country round this city. The court was held in the
hall of the ancient parliament house, and was composed of
three civil judges (one of whom presided) three military
judges, and two citizens. The arrangements of the court,
which was crowded, were excellent, and afforded uninterrupted
accommodations to all its members, by separate doors and
passages allotted to each, and also to the people, who were
permitted to occupy the large area in front, which gradually
rose from the last seats of the persons belonging to the court,
and enabled every spectator to have a perfect view of the
whole. Appropriate moral mottoes were inscribed in characters
of gold, upon the walls. The judges wore long laced bands,
and robes of black, lined with light blue silk, with scarfs of
blue and silver fringe, and sat upon an elevated semicircular
bench, raised upon a flight of steps, placed in a large alcove,
lined with tapestry. The secretaries, and subordinate officers
were seated below them. On the left the prisoner was placed,
without irons, in the custody of two gendarmes, formerly
called mar&eacute;chauss&eacute;es, who had their long swords drawn.<span class='pagenum'>52</span>
These soldiers have a very military appearance, and are a fine,
and valuable body of men. I fear the respectable impression
which I would wish to convey of them will suffer, when I
inform my reader, that they are servants of the police,
and answer to our Bow-street runners. The swiftness with
which they pursue, and apprehend offenders, is surprising.
We were received with politeness, and conducted to a convenient
place for hearing, and seeing all that passed. The
accusateur general who sat on the left, wore a costume similar
to that of the judges, without the scarf. He opened the trial
by relating the circumstances, and declaiming upon the enormity
of the offence, by which it appeared that the prisoner
stood charged with robbery, accompanied with breach of
hospitality; which, in that country, be the amount of the
plunder ever so trifling, is at present capital. The address of
the public accuser was very florid, and vehement, and attended
by violent gestures, occasionally graceful. The pleaders of
Normandy are considered as the most eloquent men in France,
I have heard several of them, but they appear to me, to be
too impassioned. Their motions in speaking frequently look
like madness. He ransacked his language to furnish himself
with reproachful epithets against the miserable wretch by the
side of him, who with his hands in his bosom appeared to
listen to him, with great sang froid. The witnesses who were
kept separate, previous to their giving their evidence, were
numerous, and proved many robberies against him, attended
with aggravated breaches of hospitality. The court entered
into proofs of offences committed by the prisoner at different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
times, and upon different persons. The women who gave
their testimony, exhibited a striking distinction between the timidity
of english females, confronting the many eyes of a
crowded court of justice, and the calm self possession with
which the french ladies here delivered their unperturbed testimony.
The charges were clearly proved, and the prisoner
was called upon for his defence. Undismayed, and with all
the practised hardihood of an Old Bailey felon, he calmly
declared, that he purchased the pile of booty produced in the
court, for sums of money, the amount of which, he did not
then know, of persons he could not name, and in places which
he did not remember. He had no advocate. The subject
was next resumed, and closed by the official orator who
opened it. The court retired, and the criminal was reconducted
to the prison behind the hall. After an absence of
about twenty minutes, a bell rang to announce the return of
the judges, the prisoner <span class="errata" title="entered now">reentered</span>, escorted by a file of
national guards, to hear his fate. The court then resumed its
sitting. The president addressed the unhappy man, very
briefly, recapitulated his offences, and read the decree of the
republic upon them, by which he doomed him to lose his head
at four o'clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>It was then ten minutes past one!! The face of this wretched
being presented a fine subject for the pencil. His countenance
was dark, marked, and melancholy; over it was spread the
sallow tint of long imprisonment. His beard was unshorn,
and he displayed an indifference to his fate, which not
a little surprised me. He immediately retired, and upon his<span class='pagenum'>54</span>
return to his cell, a priest was sent for to prepare him for his
doom. At present, in the provinces, all criminal offences are
tried before military tribunals, qualified, as I have described
this to be, by a mixture of civil judges and bourgeois.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiar characteristics of such tribunals,
to order immediate punishment after conviction. In the present
instance, the fate of the offender was well known, for
his crimes were many, and manifest, and as the interval
allowed by military courts between the sentence, and its fulfilment,
is so very short, the administrators of the law had
postponed his trial for five months from the period of his
commitment, for the purpose of affording him an indulgent
procrastination. This mode, although arising from merciful
motives, is, I am aware, open to objection; but it would be
unfair to comment upon laws, which prevailed in times of
revolution, and are permitted only to operate, until the fine
fabric of french criminal jurisprudence, which is now constructing,
shall be presented to the people. To the honour
of our country, and one of the greatest ornaments of the
british bar, the honourable T. Erskine, in the year 1789,
furnished the french, with some of these great principles of
criminal law, which it was impossible to perfect during the
long &aelig;ra of convulsion, and instability which followed, and
which will constitute a considerable part of that great, and
humane code, which is about to be bestowed upon the nation,
and which will, no doubt, prove to be one of the greatest
blessings, which human wisdom can confer upon human
weakness.<span class='pagenum'>55</span></p>

<p>Its foundation is nearly similar to that of our own. The
great and enlightened genius whose name I have mentioned,
has provided that the contumacy of <i>one</i> juryman shall not be
able to force the opinion of the rest.</p>

<p>After the court had broken up, I visited the town house,
which, before the revolution, was the monastery of the benedictines,
who, from what appeared of the remains of their
establishment, must have been magnificently lodged, and well
deserved during their existence, to bear the name of the
blessed. The two grand staircases are very fine, and there
is a noble garden behind. Upon entering the vestibule of the
council chamber, formerly the refectory, I thought I was
going behind the scenes of a theatre. It was nearly filled
with allegorical banners, pasteboard and canvas arches of
triumph, altars, emblems of liberty, and despotism, and all
the scenic decorations suitable to the frenzied orgies of a
republican f&ecirc;te. Thank God! they appeared to be tolerably
well covered with dust and cobwebs. At the end of this noble
room, seated upon a high pedestal, was the goddess of liberty,
beautifully executed in marble. "Look at that sanguinary
prostitute," cried Mons. G&mdash;&mdash;, to me, pointing to the
statue, "for years have we had liberty and bloodshed, <i>thank
Heaven!</i> we are now no longer <i>free</i>." Upon which, he
wrote his name in the first consul's book, which was here lying
open, upon a table, for the purpose of receiving the suffrages
of the department.</p>

<p>The laconic irony, and manner of the speaker, afforded me
a tolerably good display of the nature of the blessings conferred
upon the french, by their late political philosophy.<span class='pagenum'>56</span></p>

<p>From this place I proceeded to the ci-devant convent of
the jesuits, built by one of the munificent dukes de Bourbon.
It is a magnificent oblong stone building. In the centre of
the court was a tree of liberty, which, like almost all the other
trees, dedicated to that goddess, which I saw, looked blighted,
and sickly. I mention it as a fact, without alluding to any
political sentiment whatever. It is a remark in frequent use
in France, that the caps of liberty are without heads, and
the trees of liberty without root. The poplar has been selected
from all the other trees of the forest, for this distinguished
honour, from a whimsical synonymy of its name with that
of the people. In french, the poplar is called peuplier, and the
word peuple signifies people. This fine building is now converted
into an university of learning, and the fine arts. From
the number of the students, I should suppose the fashionable
fervour of study had not as yet reached Rouen.</p>

<p>The professor of philosophy, with great politeness sent a young
man to show me the museum of pictures, for which purpose the
church of the jesuits, is at present used. There are several paintings
in it, the only fine one, was a dying Jesus by Vandyke,
which was exquisite. Upon my expressing my admiration, a
young student near me said "oui monsieur c'est tr&egrave;s jolie."
This misapplied remark, from an easy and natural combination
of sound, could not fail of seeming a little singular as applied to
such a subject, but every thing that pleases in France is tr&egrave;s
jolie. From this painting, I was, by importunity, led to view
the other parts of the collection, which were composed of large
pictures, by french masters; and so natural is local prejudice,<span class='pagenum'>57</span>
every where, that I was almost held down, before the works of
the <i>best artists of Rouen</i>, upon which, as I am at liberty <i>here</i>,
I shall beg to make no comment.</p>

<p>In the students' room, below, were some paintings curious,
and valuable only, from their great antiquity, and a few good
copies by the pupils. A picture was pointed out to me as a very
fine thing, the subject was a fat little cherub, with a full flowing
wig, fiddling to St. Francis, who from his gloomy appearance
seemed not to possess half the musical genius of a dancing
bear.</p>

<p>Upon my return through the market place, I beheld the
miserable wretch, at whose trial I was present in the morning,
led out to execution. He was seated upon the bottom of a cart,
stripped above to his shirt, which was folded back, his arms
were pinioned close behind, and his hair was closely cropped,
to prevent the stroke of the fatal knife from being impeded. A
priest was seated in a chair beside him. As the object of my
excursion was to contemplate the manners of the people, I
summoned resolution to view this gloomy and painful spectacle,
which seemed to excite but little sensation in the market place,
where its petty traffic and concerns proceeded with their accustomed
activity, and the women at their stalls, which extended
to the foot of the scaffold, appeared to be impressed only with
the solicitude of selling their vegetables to the highest bidder. A
small body of the national guards, and a few boys and idlers surrounded
the fatal spot. The guillotine, painted red, was placed
upon a scaffold, of about five feet high. As soon as the criminal
ascended the upper step which led to it he mounted, by<span class='pagenum'>58</span>
the direction of the executioner, a little board, like a shutter,
raised upright to receive him, to which he was strapped, turned
down flat, and run into a small ring of iron half opened and
made to admit the neck, the top part of which was then closed
upon it, a black leather curtain was placed before the head,
from which a valve depended, which communicated to a tub,
placed under the scaffold to receive the blood, the executioner
then touched a long thin iron rod, connected with the top of the
instrument, and in a moment the axe descended, which was
in the form of a square, cut diagonally, heavily charged with
lead. The executioner and his assistants placed the body
in a shell, half filled with saw dust, which was almost completely
stained over with the brown blood of former executions;
they then picked up the head, from a bag into which it
had fallen, within the curtain, and having placed it in the
same gloomy depository, lowered the whole down to the sextons,
who covering it with a pall bore it off to the place of
burial.</p>

<p>The velocity of this mode of execution can alone recommend
it. The pangs of death are passed almost in the same moment,
which presents to the terrified eye of the sufferer the frightful
apparatus of his disgraceful dissolution. It is a dreary subject to
discuss; but surely it is a matter of deep regret, that in England,
criminals doomed to die, from the uncertain and lingering nature
of their annihilation, are seen writhing in the convulsions
of death during a period dreadful to think of. It is said, that
at the late memorable execution of an african governor for
murder, the miserable delinquent was beheld for <i>fifteen mi<span class='pagenum'>59</span>nutes</i>
struggling with the torments of his untimely fate!
The guillotine is far preferable to the savage mode, formerly
used in France, of breaking the criminal upon the wheel,
and leaving him afterwards to perish in the most poignant
agonies.</p>

<p>As I have alluded to the fate of governor W&mdash;&mdash;, I will conclude
this chapter by relating an anecdote of the terror and
infatuation of guilt, displayed in the conduct of this wretched
man, in the <i>presence</i> of a friend of mine, from whom I received
it&mdash;A few years before he suffered, fatigued with life, and pursued
by poverty, and the frightful remembrance of his offences,
then almost forgotten by the world, he left the south of France
for Calais, with an intention of passing over to England, to
offer himself up to its laws, not without the cherished hope
that a lapse of twenty years had swept away all evidence of
his guilt.</p>

<p>At the time of his arrival at this port town, the hotel in
which Madame H&mdash;&mdash; was waiting for a packet to Dover was
very crowded&mdash;the landlord requested of her, that she would be
pleased to permit two gentlemen, who were going to England,
to take some refreshment in her room; these persons proved
to be the unfortunate Brooks, a king's messenger, charged
with important dispatches to his court, and governor W&mdash;&mdash;.
The latter was dressed like a decayed gentleman, and bore
about him all the indications of his extreme condition. They
had not been seated at the table long, before the latter informed
the former, with evident marks of perturbation, that<span class='pagenum'>60</span>
his name was W&mdash;&mdash;, that having been charged in England
with offences, which, if true, subjected him to heavy punishment,
he was anxious to place himself at the disposal of its laws, and
requested of him, as he was an english messenger, that he would
consider him as his prisoner, and take charge of him.</p>

<p>The messenger, who was much surprised by the application
told him, that he could not upon such a representation take
him into custody, unless he had an order from the duke of
Portland's office to that effect, and that in order to obtain it,
it would be proper for him to write his name, that it might be
compared with his hand writing in the office of the secretary
at war, which he offered to carry over with him. Governor
W&mdash;&mdash; still pressed him to take him into custody, the messenger
more strongly declined it, by informing him that he was the
bearer of dispatches of great importance to his court, that he
must immediately cross the Channel, and should hazard a passage,
although the weather looked lowering, in an open boat,
as no packets had arrived, and that consequently it was altogether
impossible to take him over, but again requested him to
write his name, for the purpose already mentioned; the governor
consented, pens and paper were brought, but the hand of the
murderer shook so dreadfully, that he could <i>not write it</i>, and
in an agony of mind, bordering upon frenzy, he rushed out of
the room, and immediately left the town.</p>

<p>The messenger entered the boat, and set sail; a storm quickly
followed, <i>the boat sunk in sight of the pier</i>, and all on board but
one of the watermen, perished!!!<span class='pagenum'>61</span></p>

<p>The great disposer of human destiny, in vindication of his
eternal justice, rescued the life of this infatuated delinquent from
the waves, and from a sudden death, to resign him to the public
and merited doom of the laws.<span class='pagenum'>62</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Filial Piety.&mdash;St. Catharine's Mount.&mdash;Madame Phillope.&mdash;General
Ruffin's Trumpet.&mdash;Generosity.&mdash;Love Infectious.&mdash;Masons and
Gardeners.</i></p></div>


<p>I have before had occasion to mention the humane conduct
of Madame G&mdash;&mdash; towards the persecuted abb&egrave;; she soon
afterwards, with the principal ladies of the city, fell under the
displeasure of Robespierre, and his agents. Their only crime
was wealth, honourably acquired. A committee, composed of
the most worthless people of Rouen, was formed, who, in the
name of, and for the use of the nation, seized upon the valuable
stock of Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, who were natives of France. In one
night, by torchlight, their extensive warehouses were sacked,
and all their stores were forcibly sold in the public marketplace
to the best bidder: the plundered merchants were paid
the amount of the sale in assignats, in a paper currency which
then bore an enormous discount, and shortly afterwards retained
only the value of the paper upon which the national
note was written. In short, in a few hours an honourable
family, nobly allied, were despoiled of property to the amount
of 25,000<i>l.</i> sterling. Other merchants shared the same fate.
This act of robbery was followed by an act of cruelty. Madame
G&mdash;&mdash;, the mother, who was born in England, and who married
a French gentleman of large fortune, whom she survived,
of a delicate frame and advanced in years, was committed to<span class='pagenum'>63</span>
prison, where, with many other female sufferers, she was closely
confined for eleven months, during which time she was compelled
to endure all sorts of privations. After the committee
of rapine had settled their black account, and had remitted
the guilty balance to their employers, the latter, in a letter of
"friendly collusion, and fraudulent familiarity," after passing
a few revolutionary jokes upon what had occurred, observed
that the G&mdash;&mdash;s seemed to bleed very freely, and that as it
was likely they must have credit with many persons to a large
amount, directed their obedient and active banditti to order
these devoted gentlemen to draw, and to deliver to them, their
draughts upon all such persons who stood indebted to their
extensive concern. In the words of a celebrated orator<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,
"Though they had shaken the tree till nothing remained upon
the leafless branches, yet a new flight was on the wing, to
watch the first buddings of its prosperity, and to nip every
hope of future foliage and fruit."</p>

<p>The G&mdash;&mdash;s expected this visit, and, by an ingenious, and
justified expedient, prevented their perdition from becoming
decisive.</p>

<p>Soon after the gates of the prison were closed upon Madame
G&mdash;&mdash;, her eldest son, a man of commanding person, and eloquent
address, in defiance of every friendly, and of every
affectionate entreaty, flew to Paris.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of the last winter which beheld its
snows crimsoned with revolutionary carnage, when he pre<span class='pagenum'>64</span>sented
himself, undismayed, before that committee, whose
horrible nature will be better described by merely relating the
names of its members, then sitting, than by the most animated
and elaborate delineations of all its deadly deeds of
rapine and of blood. At a table, covered with green cloth,
shabbily lighted, in one of the committee rooms of the national
assembly, were seated Robespierre, Collot d'Herbois, Carnot, and
David. They were occupied in filling up the lists for the
<i>permanent</i> guillotine, erected very near them, in la Place de la
Revolution, which the executioners were then clearing of its
gore, and preparing for the next day's butchery. In this
devoted capital more blood had, during that day, streamed upon
the scaffold, than on any one day during the revolution.</p>

<p>The terrified inhabitants, in darkness, in remote recesses of
their desolate houses, were silently offering up a prayer to the
great God of Mercy to release them, in a way most suitable
to his wisdom, from such scenes of deep dismay, and remorseless
slaughter.</p>

<p>Robespierre, as usual, was dressed with great neatness and
gayety; the <i>savage</i> was generally <i>scented</i>, whilst his associates
were habited, en Jacobin, in the squalid, filthy fashion of that
era of the revolution, in the dress of blackguards.</p>

<p>Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; bowed, and addressed them very respectfully.
"I am come, citizens, before you," said this amiable son, "to
implore the release of my mother; she is pining in the
prison of Rouen, without having committed any offence;
she is in years; and if her confinement continues, her children
whose fortunes have been placed at the disposal of the<span class='pagenum'>65</span>
national exigencies, will have to lament her death; grant
the prayer of her son, restore, I conjure you, by all the
rights of nature, restore her to her afflicted family." Robespierre
looked obliquely at him, and with his accustomed
sharpness, interrupted him from proceeding further, by exclaiming,
"what right have <i>you</i> to appear before us, miscreant?
you are an agent of Pitt and Cobourg (the then common
phrase of reproach) you shall be sent to the guillotine&mdash;Why
are you not at the frontiers?" Monsieur G&mdash;&mdash;,
unappalled, replied, "give me my mother, and I will be there
to morrow, I am ready instantly to spill my blood, if it
must be the price of <i>her</i> discharge." Robespierre, whose
savage soul was occasionally moved by sights of heroic virtue,
seemed impressed by this brave and unusual address. He
paused, and after whispering a few words to his associates,
wrote the discharge, and handing it over to a soldier, for the
successful petitioner, he fiercely told him to retire.</p>

<p>Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; instantly set out for Rouen, where, after a long,
and severe journey, he arrived, exhausted with fatigue, and
agitation of mind; without refreshment, this excellent man
flew to the gates of the prison, which contained his mother,
and presented the discharge to the gaoler, who drily, with a
brutal grin, informed him, that a trick had been played off
upon him, that he had just received a counter order, which he
held in his hand, and refused to release her!!!</p>

<p>It turned out, that immediately after Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; had left
the committee room, the relenting disposition, which he had<span class='pagenum'>66</span>
momentarily awakened in the barbarous breast of Robespierre,
had subsided.</p>

<p>The generous sentiment was of a short, and sickly growth,
and withered under the gloomy, fatal shade of his sanguinary
nature. A chasseur had been dispatched with the counterorder,
who passed the exulting, but deluded G&mdash;&mdash; on the
road.</p>

<p>A short time after this, and a few days before Madame
G&mdash;&mdash;, and her unhappy companions were to have perished
on the scaffold, the gates of their prison flew open, the world
was released from a monster&mdash;Robespierre was no more.</p>

<p>This interesting recital I received from one of the amiable
sufferers, in our way to St. Catharine's Mount. The story
afforded a melancholy contrast to the rich and cheerful scenes
about us.</p>

<p>From the attic story of a lofty house, built under this celebrated
cliff, we ascended that part of it, which, upon the
road to Paris, is only accessible in this manner. When we
reached the top, the prospect was indeed superb; on one side
we traced for miles, the romantic meanders of the Seine, every
where forming little islands of poplars; before us, melting
away in the horizon, were the blue mountains of Lower
Normandy; at their feet, a variegated display of meadows,
forests, corn fields, and vineyards; immediately below us, the
city of Rouen, and its beautiful suburbs. This delicious, and
expanded prospect, we enjoyed upon a seat erected near a
little oratory, which is built upon the top of the mountain,<span class='pagenum'>67</span>
resting, at one end, upon the pedestal of a cross, which, in
the times of the revolution, had been shattered and overturned.</p>

<p>From this place, before dinner, we proceeded to la Montagne;
a wild and hilly country, lying opposite to St. Catharine's.
Here we were overtaken by a storm, upon which, a
cur&eacute;, who had observed us from his little cottage, not far
distant, and who had been very lately reinstated in the cure
of the church, in the neighbouring village, came out to us,
with an umbrella, and invited us to dinner. Upon our return
to our inn, to dress, we were annoyed by a nuisance which
had before frequently assailed us. I knew a man, who in a
moment of ill humour, vented rather a revengeful wish that
the next neighbour of his enemy might have a child, who
was fond of a <i>whistle</i> and a <i>drum</i>! A more insufferable nuisance
was destined for us; the person who lodged in the next room
to mine, was a beginner (and a dull one too) upon the <i>trumpet</i>.
It was general Ruffin, whom I have mentioned before, forcing
from this brazen tube, sounds which certainly would have set
a kennel of hounds in a cry of agony, and were almost calculated
to disturb the repose of the dead. General Ruffin, in
all other respects, was a very polite, and indeed a very <i>quiet</i>
young man, and a brave warrior; but in the display of his
passion for music, I fear he mistook either his talent or his
instrument. At one time we thought of inviting him to dine
with us, that we might have a little respite, but after debating
the matter well over, we conceived that to entertain an italian
hero, as he ought to be received by those who admire valour
even in an enemy, was purchasing silence at a very advanced<span class='pagenum'>68</span>
price, so we submitted to the evil with that resignation which
generally follows the incurable absence of a remedy. We
now addressed ourselves to Madame P&mdash;&mdash;, to know how
long the general had learned the trumpet, and whether his
leisure hours were generally occupied in this way. Madame P.
was, strange to tell, not very able to afford us much information
upon the subject. She was under the influence of
love. The natural tranquillity of her disposition, was improved
by the prospect of connubial happiness, which, although a
widow, and touching the frontier of her eight and thirtieth
year, she shortly expected to receive from the son of a neighbouring
architect, who was then a minor. In this blissful
frame of mind, our fair hostess scarcely knew when the
trumpet of general R&mdash;&mdash; sounded. Her soul was in harmony
with all the world, and it was not in the power of the demon of
discord, nor even of this annoying brazen tube, to disturb her.
Madame P&mdash;&mdash; well deserved to be blessed with such equanimity,
and if <i>she</i> liked it, with such a lover, for she was a
generous and good creature.</p>

<p>A gentleman to whom I was afterwards introduced, when
the revolution began to grow hot, fled with his lady and his
children into a foreign country, where, upon the relics of a
shattered fortune he remained, until things wore a better
aspect, and enabled him, with a prospect of safety, to return
to his native country. In better times, upon his annual visits
to a noble chateau, and large estates which he once possessed
in this part of Normandy, he was accustomed to stop at the
H&ocirc;tel de Poitiers. His equipage was then splendid, and suitable<span class='pagenum'>69</span>
to his affluent circumstances. Upon his return to France,
this gentleman, harassed by losses, and fatigued by sickness,
arrived with his accomplished lady, and their elegant children,
in a hired cabriole, at the gate of Madame P&mdash;&mdash;. As soon
as their name was announced, the grateful hostess presented
herself before them, and kissing the children, burst into tears
of joy; when she had recovered herself, she addressed her old
patron, by expressing her hopes, that he had amended his
fortune abroad, and was now returning to enjoy himself in
tranquillity at home. "Alas! my good Madame P&mdash;&mdash;,"
said this worthy gentleman, "we left our country, as you know,
to save our lives, we have subsisted upon the remains of our
fortune ever since, and have sustained heavy and cruel
losses; we have been taken prisoners upon our passage, and
are now returning to our home, if any is left to us, to solicit
some reparation for our sufferings. Times are altered, Madame
P&mdash;&mdash;, you must not now consider me as formerly, when
I expended the gifts of Providence in a manner which I
hope was not altogether unworthy of the bounty which
showered them upon me, we must bow down to such dispensations,
you see I am candid with you; we are fatigued,
and want refreshment, give us, my good landlady, a little
plain dinner, such as is suitable to our present condition."</p>

<p>Madame P&mdash;&mdash; was so much affected, that she could make
no reply, and left the room.</p>

<p>Immediately all the kitchen was in a bustle, every pot and
pan were placed in instant requisition, the chamber-maids
were sent to the neighbouring confectioners for cakes, and<span class='pagenum'>70</span>
the porter was dispatched all over the city for the choicest
fruits. In a short time a noble dinner was served up to this
unfortunate family, followed by confectionary, fruits, and burgundy.
When the repast was over, Mons. O&mdash;&mdash; ordered
his bill, and his cabriole to be got ready. Madame P&mdash;&mdash;
entered, and in the most amiable manner requested him, as
she had exceeded his orders, to consider the dinner as a little
acknowledgement of her sense of his past favours; money,
though earnestly pressed upon her, she would not receive.</p>

<p>The whole of this interesting party were moved to tears,
by this little act of nature and generosity. When they entered
their carriage, they found in it bouquets of flowers, and
boxes of cakes for the little children. No doubt Madame P&mdash;&mdash;
moved lighter that day, than she ever did in her life, and
perhaps found the remembrance of her conduct upon the
occasion almost as exquisite as the hours of love, which she
appeared most happily to enjoy, when we had the honour
of being under her roof.</p>

<p>Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; could not help exhibiting much feeling,
when he related this little event to me. I must not fail to
mention that all the house seemed, for the moment, infected
with the happy disease of the mistress. General Ruffin's
valet de chambre was in love with Doroth&eacute;e, our chamber-maid;
the porter was pining for a little black eyed grisette,
who sold prints and pastry, in a stall opposite; and the ostler
was eternally quarrelling with the chef de cuisine, who repelled
him from the kitchen, which, in the person of the assistant
cook, a plump rosy norman girl, contained all the treasure<span class='pagenum'>71</span>
of his soul&mdash;love and negligence reigned throughout the household.
We rang the bells, and sacre dieu'd, but all in vain,
we suffered great inconvenience, <i>but who could be angry?</i> In
the course of our walks, and conversations, with the workmen,
whom we met, we found that most of the masons, and
gardeners of Rouen, had fought in the memorable, bloody,
and decisive battle of Marengo, at which it appears that a
great part of the military of France, within four or five hundred
miles of the capital, were present. The change they
presented was worthy of observation; we saw men sun-browned
in campaigns, and enured to all the ferocity of war,
at the sound of peace assuming all the tranquil habits of ingenious
industry, or rustic simplicity. Some of them were
occupied in forming the shapeless stone into graceful embellishments
for elegant houses, and others in disposing, with
botanic taste, the fragrant parterre. After spending four very
delightful days in this agreeable city, I bade adieu to my
very worthy companion, captain W. C&mdash;&mdash;, whose intention it
was to spend some time here, and those friends, from whom
I had received great attention and hospitalities, and wishing
the amiable Madame P&mdash;&mdash; many happy years, and receiving
from her the same assurances of civility, about seven o'clock
in the evening I seated myself in the diligence for Paris,
and in a comfortable corner of it, after we had passed the pav&eacute;,
resigned myself to sleep.<span class='pagenum'>72</span></p>

<p>At day break, the appearance of the country in all directions
was delightful. The faint eastern blush of early morn, threw
a mild, refreshing light over the moist and dew-dripping
scenery.</p>

<p>The spirit of our immortal bard, awaking from the bosom of
nature, seemed to exclaim&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Look love, what envious streaks</span>
<span class="i0">Do lace the severing clouds, in yonder east;</span>
<span class="i0">Night's candles are burnt out; and jocund Day</span>
<span class="i0">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</span>
</div></div>

<p>About eight o'clock in the morning, we arrived at Mante, a
picturesque town, built upon a fertile mountain, at the base of
which the Seine flowed along, rippling against its many islands of
beautiful poplars. At this hour, upon our alighting at the inn,
we found a regular dinner ready, consisting of soups, meats,
fowls, and confectionary. To the no small <span class="correction" title="surprsie">surprise</span> of the host,
I expressed a wish to have some breakfast, and at length, after
much difficulty, procured some coffee and rolls.<span class='pagenum'>73</span></p>

<p>The rest of the party, with great composure, tucked their
napkins in the buttonholes of their waistcoats, and applied themselves
to the good things before them, with very active address.
What a happy race of people! ready for every thing, and at all
times; they scarcely know the meaning of inconvenience.</p>

<p>In the midst of difficulty, they find accommodation; with
them, every thing seems in harmony. After paying thirty sols
for my repast, a charge which announced our approach to the
capital, I walked on, and made my way to the bridge over another
winding of the Seine, at the bottom of the town; which
is a light, and elegant structure. The houses along the sides
of the river are handsome, and delightfully situated. The
principal church is a fine gothic building, but is rapidly hastening
to decay; some of its pinnacles are destroyed, and all
its windows broken in.</p>

<p>A small chapel, in the street opposite, which had an appearance
of considerable elegance, was converted into a slaughter-house.
Embosomed in woods, on the other side of the
bridge, is a fine chateau, formerly belonging to the count d'Adhemar;
here, while enjoying the enchanting prospect about me, I
heard the jingling approach of our heavy diligence, in which,
having reseated myself, we proceeded upon a fine high road,
through thick rows of walnut, cherry, mulberry, and apple
trees, for several miles, on each side of which, were vineyards,
upon whose promising vintage, the frost had committed sad
devastation. For a vast extent, they appeared blackened and
burnt up. It was said that France sustained a loss of two millions
sterling, by this unusual visitation.<span class='pagenum'>74</span></p>

<p>In the course of our journey, I experienced in the conduct of
one of our two female companions, an occurrence, allied to that,
which is related by Sterne, of Madame de Rambouillet, by
which he very justly illustrates the happy ease, with which the
french ladies prevent themselves from ever suffering by inconvenient
notions of delicacy.</p>

<p>A few miles from Mante, on the borders of the Seine, we
passed one of the venerable chateaus of the celebrated duke de
Sully, the faithful, able, and upright minister, of Henry IV
of France, one of those great geniuses, who only at distant &aelig;ras
of time, are permitted to shine out amongst the race of men.
Historians unite in observing that the duke performed all the
duties of an active and upright minister, under a master, who
exercised all the offices of a great and good king; after whose
unhappy fate, this excellent man retired from the busy scenes
of the world, and covered with time and honours expired in the
eighty-second year of his age in the year 1641, at his castle of
Villebon. The house is plain, and large. The grounds are
disposed after the fashion of ancient times.</p>

<p>As we approached the capital, the country looked very rich
and luxuriant. We passed through the forest of St. Germains,
where there is a noble palace, built upon a lofty mountain.
The forest abounds with game, and formerly afforded the delights
of the chase to the royal Nimrods of France. Its numerous
green alleys are between two and three miles long, and
in the form of radii unite in a centre. The forest and park
extend to the barrier, through which, we immediately entered
the town of St. Germains, distant from Paris about twelve miles,<span class='pagenum'>75</span>
which is a large and populous place, and in former periods,
during the royal residence, was rich and flourishing, but having
participated in the blessings of the revolution, presents an appearance
of considerable poverty, and squalid decay. Here we
changed horses for the last post, and ran down a fine, broad
paved, royal road through rows of stately elms, upon an inclined
plane, until the distant, and wide, but clear display of
majestic domes, awful towers, and lofty spires, informed us that
we approached the capital. I could not help comparing
them with their cloud-capped brethren of London, over whose
dim-discovered heads, a floating mass of unhealthy smoke, for
ever suspends its heavy length of gloom. Our carriage stopped
at the Norman Barrier, which is the grand entrance to Paris,
and here presents a magnificent prospect to the eye. The
barrier is formed of two very large, and noble military stone
lodges, having porticoes, on all sides, supported by massy doric
pillars. These buildings were given to the nation, by the
national assembly in the year 1792, and are separated from each
other, by a range of iron gates, adorned with republican emblems.
Upon a gentle declivity; through quadruple rows of
elms, at the distance of a mile and a half, the gigantic statues
of la Place de la Concorde (ci-devant, de la Revolution) appear;
beyond which, the gardens, and the palace of the Thuilleries,
upon the centre tower of which, the tricoloured flag was
waving, form the back scene of this splendid spectacle. Before
we entered la Place de la Concorde, we passed on each side
of us, the beautiful, and favourite walks of the parisians,
called les Champs Elys&eacute;es, and afterwards, on our left, the<span class='pagenum'>76</span>
elegant palace of the Garde-meuble; where we entered the
streets of Paris, and soon afterwards alighted at the bureau of
the diligences; from which place, I took a fiacre (a hackney
coach) and about six o'clock in the evening presented myself
to the <i>mistress</i> of the h&ocirc;tel de Rouen, for the women of France
generally transact all the masculine duties of the house. To this
hotel I was recommended by Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, upon mentioning
whose name, I was very politely shown up to a suite of
pleasant apartments, consisting of an antiroom, bedroom,
and dressing-room, the two latter were charmingly situated,
the windows of which, looked out upon an agreeable garden
belonging to the palace of the Louvre. For these rooms I
paid the moderate price of three livres a day. Here, after
enjoying those comforts which travellers after long journies, require,
and a good dinner into the bargain, about nine o'clock at
night I sallied out to the Palais Royal, a superb palace built by
the late duke d'Orleans, who when he was erecting it, publickly
boasted, that he would make it one of the greatest brothels
in Europe, in which prediction he succeeded, to the full consummation
of his abominable wishes. This palace is now the
property of the nation. The grand entrance is from the Rue
St. Honor&egrave;, a long street, something resembling the Piccadilly
of London, but destitute, like all the other streets of Paris,
of that ample breadth, and paved footway, for the accommodation
of pedestrian passengers, which give such a decided superiority
to the streets of the capital of England. After passing
through two noble courts, I entered the piazza, of this
amazing pile; which is built of stone, upon arches, sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>ported
by corinthian pilasters. Its form is an oblong square,
with gardens, and walks in the centre. The whole is considered
to be, about one thousand four hundred feet long, and
three hundred feet broad. The finest shops of Paris for
jewellery, watches, clocks, mantuamakers, restaurateurs<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, china,
magazines, &amp;c., form the back of the piazza, which on
all the sides, of this immense fabric, affords a very fine promenade.
These shops once made a part of the speculation, of
their mercenary, and abandoned master, to whom they each paid
a rent after the rate of two or three hundred pounds sterling
per annum. This place presents a scene of profligate voluptuousness,
not to be equalled upon any spot in Europe. Women
of character are almost afraid to appear here at noon day;
and a stranger would conceive, that at night, he saw before
him, one third of the beauty of Paris.</p>

<p>Under the roof of this palace are two theatres, museums of
curiosities, the tribunate, gaming houses, billiard rooms, buillotte
clubs, ball rooms, &amp;c., all opening into the gardens,
the windows of which threw, from their numerous lamps, and
lustres, a stream of gay and gaudy light upon the walks
below, and afforded the appearance of a <span class="errata" title="perpetual">vast</span> illumination.
At the bottom was a large pavilion, finely illuminated,
in which were groups of people regaling themselves
with lemonade, and ices. Upon this spot, in the early part
of the revolution, the celebrated Camille Desmoulins used to
declaim against the abuses of the old government, to all the<span class='pagenum'>78</span>
idle and disaffected of Paris. It is said that the liveries of the
duc d'Orleans gave birth to the republican colours, which used
to be displayed in the hats of his auditors, who in point of
respectability resembled the motley reformers of Chalk Farm.
From the carousing rooms under ground, the ear was filled
with the sounds of music, and the buzzing of crowds; in short,
such a scene of midnight revelry and dissipation I never before
beheld.</p>

<p>Upon my return to my h&ocirc;tel, I was a little surprised to
find the streets of this gay city so meanly lighted. Lamps
placed at gloomy distances from each other, suspended by
cords, from lofty poles, furnish the only means of directing
the footsteps of the nocturnal wanderer.<span class='pagenum'>79</span></p>

<p>I forgot, in my last chapter, to mention that I paid for
my place, and luggage in the diligence, from Rouen to Paris,
a distance of ninety miles, twenty-three livres and eighteen
sols. The next morning after my arrival, and a good night's
repose in a sopha bed, constructed after the french fashion,
which was very lofty, and handsome, and very comfortable,
I waited upon my accomplished friend, Madame H&mdash;&mdash;, in
the Rue Florentine. I had the honour of knowing her when
in England, from very early years; I found her with her elegant
and accomplished daughter, in a suite of large rooms,
very handsomely furnished after the <i>antique</i>, which gives to
the present fashionable furniture of France, its form and character.
These rooms composed a floor of a noble stone built
house, which contained several other families; such is the
customary mode of being lodged in the capital. She received
me in the most charming manner, and had expected me for
some days, previous to my arrival, and was that evening going
to her country house at Passi, a few miles from Paris, whither
she pressed me to accompany her, but I declined it, on<span class='pagenum'>80</span>
account of the short time which I had before me to spend
in Paris. Madame H&mdash;&mdash; was not only a beauty, but a woman
of wit and learning, and had accordingly admitted Voltaire
amongst the number of her household gods; the arch old
cynic, with his deathlike sarcastic face, admirably represented,
by a small whole length porcelain statue, occupied
the centre of her chimney piece. Upon finding that I was
disposed to remain in town, she recommended me to a restaurateur,
in the gardens of the Thuilleries, one of the first eating
houses in Paris, for society, and entertainment, to the master
of which she sent her servant, with my name, to inform him,
that she had recommended an english gentleman of her acquaintance
to his house, and requested that an english servant
in his service might attend to me, when I dined there. This
was a little valuable civility, truly french. This house has
been lately built under the auspices of the first consul, from
a design, approved of by his own exquisite taste; he has permitted
the entrance to open into the gardens of the consular
palace. The whole is from a model of one of the little palaces
of the Herculaneum, it is upon a small scale, built of a
fine white stone, it contains a centre, with a portico, supported
by doric pillars, and two long wings. The front is upon the
terrace of the gardens, and commands an enchanting view of
all its beautiful walks and statues. On the ground floor the
house is divided into three long and spacious apartments,
opening into each other through centre arches, and which
are redoubled upon the view by immense pier glasses at each
end. The first room is for dinner parties, the next for ices,<span class='pagenum'>81</span>
and the third for coffee. In the middle is a flying staircase,
lined on each side with orange trees, which ascends into a
suite of upper dinner rooms, all of which are admirably painted
after the taste of the Herculaneum, and are almost lined with
costly pier glasses.</p>

<p>My fair countrywomen would perhaps be a little surprised
to be told, that elegant women, of the first respectability, superbly
dressed for the promenade, dine here with their friends
in the public room, a custom which renders the scene delightful,
and removes from it the accustomed impressions of grossness.
Upon entering, the guest is presented with a dinner
chart, handsomely printed, enumerating the different dishes
provided for that day, with their respective prices affixed. All
the people who frequent this place are considered highly respectable.
The visitor is furnished with ice for his water decanters,
with the best attendance at dinner, and with all the
english and foreign newspapers. I always dined here when I
was not engaged. After parting from Madame H&mdash;&mdash;, who
intended returning to town the next day, I went to see the
consular guard relieved at the Thuilleries. About five companies
of this distinguished regiment assemble in the gardens,
exactly at five minutes before twelve o'clock, and, preceded
by their fine band of music, march through the hall of the
palace, and form the line in the grand court yard before it,
where they are joined by a squadron of horse. Their uniform
is blue, with broad white facings.</p>

<p>The consular guard were in a little disgrace, and were not
permitted to do the entire duty of the palace at this time,<span class='pagenum'>82</span>
nor during several succeeding days, as a mark of the first
consul's displeasure, which had been excited by some unguarded
expression of the common men, respecting his conduct,
and which, to the jealous ear of a new created and untried
authority, sounded like the tone of disaffection. Only
the cavalry were allowed to mount guard, the infantry were,
provisionally, superseded by a detachment from a fine regiment
of hussars. On account of the shortness of this parade,
which is always dismissed precisely at ten minutes past twelve
o'clock, it is not much attended. The band is very fine,
they had a turkish military instrument, which I never heard
before, and was used instead of triangles. It was in the shape
of four canopies, like the roofs of chinese temples, one
above another, lessening as they ascended, made of thin plates
of brass, and fringed with very little brass bells, it was supported
by a sliding rod which dropped into a handle, out of
which, when it was intended to be sounded, it was suddenly
jerked by the musician, and produced a good effect with the
other instruments. The tambour major is remarked for his
noble appearance, and for the proportions of his person, which
is very handsome: his full dress uniform on the grand parade
is the most splendid thing, I ever beheld. The corps of pioneers
who precede the regiment, have a singular appearance. These
men are rather above six feet high, and proportionably made,
they wear fierce mustachios, and long black beards, lofty
bear skin caps, broad white leathern aprons, which almost
touch their chins, and over their shoulders carry enormous
hatchets. Their strange costume seemed to unite the dissi<span class='pagenum'>83</span>milar
characters of high priest, and warrior. They looked
like <i>military magi</i>. The common men made a very martial
appearance. Their officers wore english riding boots, which
had an unmilitary effect. Paris at present exhibits all the appearances
of a city in a state of siege. The consular palace
resembles a line of magnificent barracks, at the balconies, and
upon the terraces of which, soldiers are every where to be
seen lounging. This palace is partitioned between the first and
second consuls, the third principal magistrate resides in a palace
near the Louvre, opposite to the Thuilleries. The four colossal
brazen horses, called the venetian horses, which have
been brought from Venice, are mounted upon lofty pedestals,
on each side of the gates of the grand court yard of the palace.
When the roman emperor Constantine founded Constantinople,
he attached these exquisite statues to the chariot of the Sun
in the hippodromus, or circus, and when that capital was
taken possession of by the venetian and french crusading
armies, in 1206, the venetians obtained possession of them,
amongst many other inestimable curiosities, and placed these
horses in four niches over the great door of the church of
St. Marco. Respecting their previous history, authors very
much differ; some assert that they were cast by the great
statuary Lysippus, in Alexander's time, others that they were
raised over the triumphal arch of Augustus, others of Nero,
and thence removed to the triumphal arch of Constantine, from
which he carried them to his own capital.</p>

<p>They are said to be composed of bronze and gold, which
much resembles the famous composition of the corinthian<span class='pagenum'>84</span>
brass. Although these statues are of an enormous size, they
are too diminutive for the vast pile of building which they
adorn. The same remark applies to the entrance gates, of
massy iron, which have just been raised by the directions of
the first consul. The tricolour flag, mounted upon the centre
dome of the palace, is also too small. From the court yard I
entered the gardens, which are very beautiful, and about seven
o'clock in the evening, form one of the favourite and fashionable
walks of the parisians. They are disposed in regular promenades,
in which are many fine casts from the ancient statues,
which adorn the hall of antiques, and on each side are noble
orange trees, which grow in vast moveable cases; many of these
exotics are twenty feet high. Until lately many of the antiques
were placed here, but Bonaparte, with his accustomed
judgment and veneration for the arts, has had them removed
into the grand national collection, and has supplied their
places by these beautiful copies, amongst which I particularly
distinguished those of Hippomanes, and Atalanta, for the beauty
of their proportions, and the exquisite elucidation of their
story. Here are also some fine basins of water, in the middle
of which are jets d'eau. The gravel walks of the gardens are
watered every morning in hot weather, and centinels are stationed
at every avenue, to preserve order: no person is admitted
who is the carrier of a parcel, however small. Here are
groups of people to be seen, every morning, reading the prints
of the day, in the refreshing coolness of the shade. For the
use of a chair in the gardens, of which there are some hundreds,
the proprietor is thankful for the smallest coin of the republic.<span class='pagenum'>85</span>
At the bottom of the steps, leading to the terrace, in front of
the palace, are some beautiful vases, of an immense size, which
are raised about twelve feet from the ground: in one of them,
which was pointed out to me, an unpopular and persecuted
Parisian saved nearly all his property, during the revolution.
A short time before the massacre of the 10th of August, 1792,
when the domiciliary visits became frequent and keen, this man,
during a dark night, stole, unobserved by the guards, into the
garden, with a bag under his arm, containing almost all his
treasure; he made his way to the vase, which, from the palace,
is on the right hand, next to the Feuillans, and, after some
difficulty, committed the whole to the capacious bosom of the
faithful depositary: this done, he retreated in safety; and when
the time of terrour was passed, fearful that he should not be able
to raise his bag from the deep bottom of the urn without a discovery,
which might have rendered the circumstance suspicious,
and perhaps hazardous to him, he presented himself before the
minister of the police, verified the narrative of the facts, and was
placed in the quiet possession of his property, which in this
manner had remained undisturbed during all that frightful
period. From the gardens I went to the exhibition of David's
celebrated painting of the suspension of the battle between the
Sabines and the Romans, produced by the wives of the latter
rushing, with their children in their arms, between the approaching
warriors. David is deservedly considered as the first
living artist in France, and this splendid picture is worthy of
his pencil. It is upon an immense scale. All the Figures (of
which there are many) are as large as life. The principal<span class='pagenum'>86</span>
female raising her terrified infant, and the two chief combatants,
are inimitable. I was informed, by good authority, that the
court of Russia had offered 7000<i>l.</i> sterling for it, an unexampled
price for any modern painting! but that David, who
is very rich, felt a reluctance in parting with it, to the emperor,
on account of the climate of Russia being unfavourable to
colour.</p>

<p>From this beautiful painting, I went to pay my respects to
Mons. O&mdash;&mdash;, who resided at the further end of Paris, upon
whom I had a letter of credit. Upon my arriving at his hotel,
I was informed by the porter that his master was at his chateau,
about ten miles in the country, with his family, where he
lay extremely ill. This news rendered it necessary for me to
leave Paris for a day and a night at least.</p>

<p>From Mons. O&mdash;&mdash; I went to Mr. Perregaux, the rich banker
and legislator, to whom I had letters of introduction. He lives
in the Rue Mont Blanc, a street, the place of residence of
the principal bankers, and is next door neighbour to his rival
Mons. R&mdash;&mdash;, whose lady has occasioned some little conversation.
Mons. P&mdash;&mdash;'s hotel is very superb. His chief
clerks occupy rooms elegantly fitted up, and decorated with
fine paintings. He received me in a very handsome manner,
in a beautiful little cabinet, adorned with some excellent, and
costly paintings. After many polite expressions from him, I
laughingly informed him of the dilemma in which I was
placed by the unexpected absence of Mons. O&mdash;&mdash;; upon
which Mons. P&mdash;&mdash; in the most friendly manner told me
that the letters which I had brought were from persons whom<span class='pagenum'>87</span>
he highly esteemed; and that Mr. O&mdash;&mdash; was also his friend;
that as it might prove inconvenient for me to wait upon him
in the country, he begged to have the pleasure of furnishing
me with whatever money I wanted, upon my own draughts.
I felt this act of politeness and liberality very forcibly, which
I of course declined, as I wished not only to take up what
money I wanted in a regular manner, but I was desirous of
seeing Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;, who was represented to me as a very amiable
man, and his family as elegant and accomplished. I was
much charmed with the generous conduct of Mons. P&mdash;&mdash;,
from whom I afterwards received great attentions, and who is
much beloved by the English. I felt it a pleasurable duty not
to confine the knowledge of such an act of liberality to the
spot where it was so handsomely manifested. The sessions of
the legislative assembly had closed the day before my arrival,
a circumstance I much regretted, as through his means I should
have been enabled to have attended their sittings. The bankers
of France are immensely rich, and almost command the treasury
of the nation. Mons. P&mdash;&mdash;, with the well-timed, silent submission
of the flexible reed, in the fable, has survived the revolutionary
storm, which by a good, but guiltless policy, has
passed over him, without leaving one stain upon his honourable
character, and has operated, like the slime of the Egyptian
inundation, only to fructify, and increase his fortunes. He
once however narrowly escaped. In the time of Robespierre,
the Marquis de Chatelet, a few nights before his execution,
attempted to corrupt his guards, and told them, if they would
release him, Mons. P&mdash;&mdash; would give them a draft to any<span class='pagenum'>88</span>
amount which they might choose then to name. The centinels
rejected the bribe, and informed their sanguinary employer
of the offer, who had the books of Mons. P&mdash;&mdash; investigated:
he was in no shape concerned in the attempted escape; but
hearing, with extraordinary swiftness, that the marquis, whose
banker he had been, and to whom an inconsiderable balance
was then due, had implicated him in this manner, he instantly
with dexterity, removed the page which contained the last
account of the unhappy nobleman, and also his own destiny,
and thus saved his life. Mons. P&mdash;&mdash; is a widower; his
daughter, an only child, is married to a wealthy general, a man
of great bravery, and beloved by Bonaparte.</p>

<p>I dined this day at the Restaurateur's in the Thuilleries, and
found the effect of Madame H&mdash;&mdash;'s charming civility to me.
There were some beautiful women present, dressed after the
antique, a fashion successfully introduced by David. This extraordinary
genius was desirous of dressing the beaux of Paris
after the same model; but they politely declined it, alleging
that if Mons. David would at the same time create another
climate, warmer, and more regular for them, they would then
submit the matter to a committee of fashion. The women,
though said, in point of corporal sufferance, to be able to endure
less than men, were enchanted with the design of the artist,
and, without approaching a single degree nearer to the sun,
unmindful of colds, consumptions, and death, have assumed a
dress, if such it can be called, the airiness of which to the
eye of fancy, looked like the mist of incense, undulating over
a display of beauty and symmetry, only to be rivalled by<span class='pagenum'>89</span>
those exquisite models of grecian taste which first furnished
them with these new ideas of personal decoration.</p>

<p>The French ladies every morning anoint their heads with
the antique oil, scented; their sidelocks are formed into small
circles, which just touch the bosom; and the hair behind is
rolled into a rose, by which they produce a perfect copy of
the ancient bust.<span class='pagenum'>90</span></p>

<p>In the streets of Paris, I every where saw an unusual number
of very large, fierce looking dogs, partaking of the breed of the
newfoundland, and british bulldog. During the time of <span class="correction" title="terruor">terrour</span>,
these brave and faithful animals were in much request, and
are said to have given the alarm of danger, and saved, in several
instances, the lives and property of their masters, by their
accustomed fidelity. Upon my arrival in this great capital, I
was of course desirous of becoming acquainted with its leading
features as soon as possible, for the purpose of being enabled
to explore my way to any part of it, without a guide. The
scheme which I thought of, for this purpose, answered my
wishes, and therefore I may presume to submit it to others.</p>

<p>On the second day after my arrival, I purchased a map of
Paris, hired a fiacre, and drove to the Pantheon. Upon the top
gallery which surmounts its lofty and magnificent dome, I made
a survey of the city, which lay below me, like the chart with
which I compared it. The clouds passed swiftly over my head,
and from the shape of the dome, impressed me with an idea
of moving in the air, upon the top, instead of the bottom of<span class='pagenum'>91</span>
a balloon. I easily attained my object, by tracing the churches,
the temple, the abbey, the palaces, large buildings, and the
course and islands of the river, after which I seldom had occasion
to retrace my steps, when I was roving about, unaccompanied.
On account of no coal being used in Paris, the
prospect was perfectly clear, and the air is consequently salubrious.
The Pantheon, or church of St. Genevieve, is a magnificent
building from the designs of Mons. Soufflet, one of the
first architects of France: it was intended to be the rival of the
St. Paul's of London; but, though a very noble edifice, it must
fail of exciting any emotions of jealousy amongst the admirers
of that national building. It is a magnificent pile, and when
completed, is destined to be the principal place of worship, and
is at present the mausoleum of the deceased great men of
France. Upon the entablature over the portico is written, in
immense characters, "<span class="smcap">AUX GRANDS HOMMES&mdash;LA PATRIE
RECONNOISANTE</span>." Parallel with the grand entrance, are colossal
statues, representing the virtues imputed to a republic.
Soon after the completion of the inner dome, about two years
since, one of the main supporting pillars was crushed in several
places by the pressure. The defective column has been removed,
and until it can be replaced, its proportion of weight
is sustained by a most ingenious and complicated wooden
structure. Upon the spot where the altar is to be erected, I
saw another goddess of liberty, with her usual appendages
carved in wood, and painted, and raised by the order of
Robespierre, for a grand revolutionary f&ecirc;te, which he intended
to have given, in this church, upon the very day in which he<span class='pagenum'>92</span>
perished. The interior dome is covered with two larger ones,
each of which is supported by separate pillars, and pilasters,
and the whole is constructed of stone only. The interior of
the lower dome is covered with the most beautiful carvings in
stone. The peristyle, or circular colonnade round the lower
part of the exterior of the dome, is very fine, but I must
confess, I do not like an ancient fashion which the french
have just revived in their construction of these pillars, of
making the thickest part of the column a little below the
centre, and lessening in size to the base. Under this immense
fabric are spacious vaults, well lighted; supported by doric
pillars, the depositaries of the illustrious dead of France. At
present there are only two personages whose relics are honoured
with this gloomy distinction. Rousseau and Voltaire
very quietly repose by the side of each other. Their remains
are contained in two separate tombs, which are constructed of
wood, and are embellished with various inscriptions. Hamlet's
remark over the grave of Ophelia, strongly occurred
to me.</p>

<p>"Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs?
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on
a roar? not one now to mock your own grinning? quite
chapfallen?"</p>

<p>At either end of the tomb of Jean Jacques, are two hands,
darting out of the gates of death, supporting lighted torches,
and below, (it is a little singular) are inscriptions illustrating
the <i>peaceful</i>, and benevolent virtues of the enclosed defunct!</p>

<p>Peace to their manes! may they enjoy more repose, than<span class='pagenum'>93</span>
that troubled world which their extraordinary, yet different
talents seemed equally destined to embellish and to embroil,
though it would be difficult to name any two modern writers,
who have expressed, with more eloquence, a cordial love of
peace, and a zealous desire to promote the interests of humanity!!</p>

<p>The church of St. Genevieve is entirely composed of stone
and iron, of the latter very little is used. It has already cost
the nation very near two millions sterling. As I was returning
from the Pantheon, I was addressed by one of our emigrant
companions, to whom I have before alluded. He had just
arrived in Paris, intended staying about a month, and then returning
to Toulon. He warmly made me an offer of his
services, and during my stay here, sent every morning to
know if he should attend me as a friendly guide, to conduct
me to any place which I might wish to see, or to prevent me
from suffering any imposition from tradesmen. His attentions
to me were always agreeable, and sometimes serviceable, and
strongly impressed upon my mind, the policy, as well as the
pleasure, of treating every being with civility, even where first
appearances are not favourable, and where an expectation of
meeting the party again is not probable. In the course of
the day I was introduced to Madame B&mdash;&mdash;, who resides, by
permission of the first consul, in a suite of elegant apartments
in the Louvre, which have been granted to her on account
of her merits and genius, and also in consideration of the losses
which she has sustained by the revolution. In her study she
presented me to Mademoiselle T&mdash;&mdash;, the then celebrated<span class='pagenum'>94</span>
beauty of Paris; her portrait by David, had afforded much
conversation in the fashionable circles; she was then copying,
with great taste, from the antique, which is generally the
morning's occupation of the french ladies of fashion. She is
certainly a very handsome young woman: but I think if the
painter of France was to visit a certain western county of
England, he would discover as many attractions for the display
of his admirable pencil, as were at this time to be found in the
study of Madame B&mdash;&mdash;. When we left her, Madame B&mdash;&mdash;
asked me what I thought of her; I candidly made the above
remark to her, "Ah!" said she, "you should have seen her
about a month since, she was then the prettiest creature in
all France;" how so, has she suffered from indisposition?
"oh no," replied Madame B&mdash;&mdash;, smilingly, "but a <i>month</i>,
you know, makes a considerable difference upon the face
of beauty."</p>

<p>I was much obliged to Madame B&mdash;&mdash; for the remark,
which is greatly within an observation which I have frequently
made, on the evanescent nature of youthful beauty. Madame
B&mdash;&mdash;'s calculations of the given progress of decay, were
eighteen times more swift than mine. The subject of our conversation,
and the busts by which we were surrounded, naturally
led us to talk of the french ladies, and they reminded
us, though <i>slightly</i>, of their present <i>dress</i>. Madame B&mdash;&mdash;
entered into a particular account of the decorations of a lady
of fashion in France. I have not patience enough to enumerate
them here, except that the wife of a fournisseur will not hesitate
paying from three to four hundred pounds for a Cache<span class='pagenum'>95</span>mire
shawl, nor from four to five hundred pounds for a laced
gown, nor a much larger sum for diamonds cut like pearls,
and threaded. In this costly manner, does the ingenuity of art,
and the prodigality of wealth do homage to the elegance of nature.
The entrance to Madame B&mdash;&mdash;'s apartments seemed at
first, a little singular and unsuitable, but I soon found that it was
no unusual circumstance, after groping through dirty passages,
and up filthy staircases to enter a noble hall and splendid rooms.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Madame B&mdash;&mdash; I passed the Place de Carousel,
and saw the ruins of the houses, which suffered by the
explosion of the infernal machine, which afforded so much
conversation in the world at the time, by which the first
consul was intended to have been destroyed in his way to the
National Institute of Music. This affair has been somewhat
involved in mystery. It is now well known that Monsieur
Fouch&eacute;, at the head of the police, was acquainted with this conspiracy
from its first conception, and by his vigilant agents,
was informed of the daily progress made in the construction of
this destructive instrument, of the plan of which he had even
a copy. The conspirators proceeded with perfect confidence,
and as they thought with perfect security. Three days before
it was quite completed, and ready for its fell purpose, from
some surprise or dread of detection, they changed their place
of meeting, and in one night removed the machine from the spot
where it had been usually deposited. The penetrating eye of the
police lost sight of them. Fouch&eacute;, and his followers exercised
their unrivalled talents for pursuit and discovery to no purpose.
The baffled minister then waited upon Bonaparte, to whom he had<span class='pagenum'>96</span>
regularly imparted the result of every day's information respecting
it, and told him that he could no longer trace the
traiterous instrument of his assassination, and requested him, as
he knew it must be completed by this time, not to go to any
public places, until he had regained a knowledge of it. Bonaparte
replied, that fear only made cowards, and conspirators brave,
and that he had unalterably determined to go with his accustomed
equipage to the National Concert that very evening.
At the usual hour the first consul set off undismayed from the
Thuilleries, a description of the machine, which was made to
resemble a water cask, being first given to the coachman,
servants, and guards. As they proceeded, the advance guard
passed it unobserved, but the coachman discovered it just as
the consular carriage was on a parallel with it; instantly the
dexterous and faithful charioteer lashed his horses into full
speed, and turned the corner of the Rue Marcem. In one
moment after, the terrible machine exploded, and covered the
street with ruins. The thunder of its discharge shook the houses
of Paris, and was heard at a considerable distance in the country.
The first consul arrived in safety at the Hall of Music, and
with every appearance of perfect tranquillity, entered his box
amidst the acclamations of the crowded multitude. The range
of buildings which was shattered by the explosion, has long
offended the eye of taste, and presented a gloomy, and very
inconvenient obstruction to the grand entrance of the palace.
Bonaparte, with his usual judgment, which converts every
event into some good, immediately after this affair, purchased
the houses which were damaged, and the whole of this scene of<span class='pagenum'>97</span>
ruins and rubbish is removing with all possible expedition, to
the great improvement of this grand approach.</p>

<p>Whilst I was strolling along the banks of the Seine, I could
not help remarking that it would suffer much by a comparison
with the Thames, so finely described by sir John Denham&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though deep, yet clear, though gentle yet not dull:</span>
<span class="i0">Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Seine is narrow, and very dirty; its waters, which are
finely filtrated when drawn from the fountains of Paris, produce
an aperient effect upon strangers, who are generally cautioned
not to drink much of them at a time.</p>

<p>The tide does not reach further than several miles below
Paris; to this cause I can alone attribute, though perhaps the
reason is insufficient, that the river is never rendered gay by the
passing, and repassing of beautiful pleasure boats, to the delights
of which the parisians seem total strangers. Its shores
are sadly disfigured by a number of black, gloomy, and unwieldy
sheds, which are erected upon barges, for the accommodation
of the washerwomen, who, by their mode of
washing, which is, by rubbing the linen in the river water,
and beating it with large flat pieces of wood, resembling battledores,
until the dirt, and generally a portion of the linen
retire together, make a noise very similar to that of shipwrights
caulking a vessel. This is an abominable nuisance, and
renders the view up the river, from the centre of the Pont de
la Concorde, the most complete m&eacute;lange of filth and finery,<span class='pagenum'>98</span>
meanness and magnificence I ever beheld. Whilst I am speaking
of these valuable, but noisy dames, I must mention that
their services are chiefly confined to strangers, and the
humbler class of parisians. The genteel families of France
are annoyed by the unpleasant domestic occurrence of washing,
when in town only once, and when in the country only twice
in the course of the year. Their magazines of clothes are of
course immense, for the reception and arrangement of which
several rooms in their houses are always allotted. It is the
intention of the first consul gradually to unkennel this clattering
race of females, when it can be done with safety. To
force them to the tub, and to put them into the suds too suddenly,
might, from their influence amongst the lower classes
of citizens, be followed by consequences not very congenial to
the repose of the government.</p>

<p>To show of what importance the ladies of the lower class in
Paris are, I shall relate a little anecdote of Bonaparte, in which
he is considered to have exhibited as much bravery as he ever
displayed in the field of battle.</p>

<p>The poissardes, whose name alone will awaken some emotion
in the mind of the reader, from its horrible union with the
barbarous massacres which discoloured the capital with blood
during the revolution, have been from time immemorial accustomed,
upon any great and fortunate event, to send a deputation
of their sisterhood to the kings and ministers of France,
and since the revolution to the various rulers of the republic,
to ofter their congratulations, accompanied by a large bouquet
of flowers. Upon the elevation of Bonaparte to the supreme<span class='pagenum'>99</span>
authority of France, according to custom, they sent a select
number from their body to present him with their good
wishes, and usual fragrant donation. The first consul sternly
received them, and after rejecting their nosegay, fiercely told
them to retire, and in future to attend to their husbands,
their children, and their fisheries, and never more to attempt
an interference in matters relating to the state. Upon
which he ordered the pages in waiting to close the door upon
them. He thought no doubt that "Omnium manibus res
human&aelig; egent: paucorum capita sufficiunt."&mdash;"Human
affairs require the hands of all, whilst the heads of few
are sufficient."</p>

<p>These formidable dames, so celebrated for their ferocity,
retired chagrined and chapfallen from the presence of the
imperious consul, and have not attempted to force either
their congratulations, or their bouquets upon any of the
public functionaries since that period. Such a repulse
as this, offered to a body of people, more formidable
from their influence than the lazzaroni of Naples, would in
all human probability have cost any one of the kings of
France his crown. I received this anecdote from the brother
of one of the ministers of France to whom this country
is much indebted. Before the high daring of Bonaparte,
every difficulty seems to droop, and die.</p>

<p>Near the Pont de la Concorde is a handsome, and ornamental
building, which is erected upon barges, and contains
near three hundred cold and tepid baths, for men and women.
It is surrounded by a wooden terrace, which forms<span class='pagenum'>100</span>
an agreeable walk upon the water, and is decorated with
shrubs, orange trees, and flowers, on each side.</p>

<p>This place is very grateful in a climate which, in summer,
is intensely warm. There are other public baths, but
this is chiefly resorted to by people of respectability. The
price is very moderate, thirty sols.<span class='pagenum'>101</span></p>

Dame.&mdash;Museum or Palace of Arts.&mdash;Hall of
Statues.&mdash;Laocoon.&mdash;Belvidere Apollo.&mdash;Socrates.</i></p></div>


<p>During my stay in Paris I visited the gallery of David.
This celebrated artist has amassed a fortune of upwards of two
hundred thousand pounds, and is permitted by his great patron,
and friend Bonaparte, to occupy the corner wing of the old
palace, from which every other man of genius and science,
who was entitled to reside there, has been removed to other
places, in order to make room for the reception of the grand
National Library, which the first consul intends to have deposited
there. His apartments are very magnificent, and furnished
in that taste, which he has, by the influence of his
fame, and his elegance of design, so widely, and successfully
diffused. Whilst I was seated in his rooms, I could not help
fancying myself a contemporary of the most tasteful times of
Greece. Tunics and robes were carelessly but gracefully
thrown over the antique chairs, which were surrounded by
elegant statues, and ancient libraries, so disposed, as to perfect
the classical illusion. I found David in his garden, putting in
the back ground of a painting. He wore a dirty robe, and
an old hat. His eyes are dark and penetrating, and beam
with the lustre of genius. His collection of paintings and
statues, and many of his own studies, afforded a perfect banquet.<span class='pagenum'>102</span>
He was then occupied in drawing a fine portrait of Bonaparte.
The presence of David covered the gratification with gloom.
Before me, in the bosom of that art, which is said, with her
divine associates, to soften the souls of men, I beheld the
remorseless judge of his sovereign, the destroyer of his brethren
in art, and the enthusiast and confidential friend of Robespierre.
David's political life is too well known. During the
late scenes of horror, he was asked by an acquaintance, how
many heads had fallen upon the scaffold that day, to which
he is said coolly to have replied, "<i>only one hundred and twenty!!</i>
The heads of twenty thousand more must fall before the
great work of philosophy can be accomplished."</p>

<p>It is related of him, that during the reign of the Mountain,
he carried his portfolio to the front of the scaffold, to catch the
last emotions of expiring nature, from the victims of his revolutionary
rage.</p>

<p>He directed and presided at the splendid funeral solemnities
of Lepelletier, who was assassinated by Paris, in which his
taste and intimate knowledge of the ceremonies of the ancients,
on similar occasions, were eminently displayed.</p>

<p>Farewell, David! when years have rolled away, and time
has mellowed the works of thy sublime pencil, mayst thou be
remembered only as <i>their</i> creator; may thy fame repose herself
upon the tableau of the dying Socrates, and the miraculous
passage of the Alpine hero, may the ensanguined records of
thy political frenzy, moulder away, and may science, who
knew not blood till thou wert known, whose pure, and
hallowed inspirations have made men happier, and better, till<span class='pagenum'>103</span>
thou wert born, implore for thee forgiveness, and whilst, with
rapture she points to the immortal images of thy divine genius,
may she cover with an impenetrable pall, the pale, and shuddering,
and bleeding victims of thy sanguinary soul!</p>

<p>The great abilities of this man, have alone enabled him to survive
the revolution, which, strange to relate, has, throughout its
ravages, preserved a veneration for science, and, in general,
protected her distinguished followers. Bonaparte, who possesses
great taste "that instinct superior to study, surer than reasoning,
and more rapid than reflection," entertains the greatest admiration
for the genius of David, and always consults him in
the arrangement of his paintings and statues. All the costumes
of government have been designed by this artist.</p>

<p>David is not without his adherents. He has many pupils,
the sons of respectable, and some of them, of noble families
residing in different parts of Europe. They are said to be
much attached to him, and have formed themselves into a
military corps, for the purpose of occasionally doing honour
to him, and were lately on the point of revenging an insult
which had been offered to his person, in a manner, which, if
perpetrated, would have required the interest of their master
to have saved them from the scaffold.</p>

<p>But neither the gracious protection of consular favour, nor
the splendour of unrivalled abilities, can restore their polluted
possessor, to the affections and endearments of social intercourse.
Humanity has drawn a <i>sable circle</i> round him. He
leads the life of a proscribed exile, in the very centre of the
gayest city in Europe. In the gloomy shade of unchosen<span class='pagenum'>104</span>
seclusion, he passes his ungladdened hours, in the hope of
covering his guilt with his glory, and of presenting to posterity,
by the energies of his unequalled genius, some atonement
for the havoc, and ruin of that political hurricane, of
which he directed the fury, and befriended the desolations,
against every contemporary object that nature had endeared,
and virtue consecrated.</p>

<p>After leaving the gallery of David, I visited la Place de
la Concorde. This ill fated spot, from its spaciousness, and
beauty of situation, has always been the theatre of the great
f&ecirc;tes of the nation, as well as the scene of its greatest calamities.
When the nuptials of the late king and queen were
celebrated, the magnificent fireworks, shows, and illuminations
which followed, were here displayed. During the exhibition,
a numerous banditti, from Normandy, broke in upon
the vast assemblage of spectators: owing to the confusion which
followed, and the fall of some of the scaffolding, the supporters
of which were sawed through by these wretches, the disorder
became dreadful, and universal; many were crushed to death,
and some hundreds of the people, whilst endeavouring to make
their escape, were stabbed, and robbed. The king and queen,
as a mark of their deep regret, ordered the dead to be entombed
in the new burial ground of l'&Eacute;glise de Madeleine,
then erecting at the entrance of the Boulevard des Italiens,
in the neighbourhood of the palace, under the immediate
inspection and patronage of the sovereign. This building was
never finished, and still presents to the eye, a naked pile of
lofty walls and columns. Alas! the gloomy auguries which<span class='pagenum'>105</span>
followed this fatal spectacle, were too truly realized. On <i>that</i>
spot perished the monarch and his queen, and the flower of the
french nobility, and many of the virtuous and enlightened
men of France, and in <i>this</i> cemetery, their unhonoured remains
were thrown, amidst heaps of headless victims, into promiscuous
graves of unslacked lime!</p>

<p>How inscrutable are the ways of destiny!</p>

<p>This spot, which, from its enchanting scenery, is calculated
only to <span class="correction" title="recal">recall</span>, or to inspire the most tender, and generous, and
elegant sentiments, which has been the favoured resort of so
many kings, and the scene of every gorgeous spectacle, was
doomed to become the human shambles of the brave and good,
and the Golgotha of the guillotine! In the centre, is an oblong
square railing, which encloses the exact spot where formerly
stood that instrument of death, which was voted permanent by
its remorseless employers.</p>

<p>A temporary model in wood, of a lofty superb monument,
two hundred feet high, intended to be erected in honour of
Bonaparte and the battle of Marengo, was raised in this place,
for his approval, but from policy or modesty, he declined this
distinguished mark of public approbation. I was a little surprised
to observe, in the windows of the principal print shops,
prints exposed to sale, representing the late king, in his full
robes of state, under which was written, Le Restaurateur de la
libert&eacute;, (an equivoque, no doubt) and the parting interview
between that unhappy sovereign and his queen and family in
the temple, upon the morning of his execution.</p>

<p>This little circumstance will show the confidence which the<span class='pagenum'>106</span>
present rulers feel in the strength and security of the present
government; for such representations are certainly calculated
to excite feelings, and to restore impressions which might prove
a little hazardous to both, were they less powerfully supported.</p>

<p>I was also one morning a little surprised, by hearing from
my window, the exhilarating song of "Rule Britannia"
played upon a hand organ; upon looking down into the
street, I beheld a Savoyard very composedly turning the handle
of his musical machine, as he moved along, and a french
officer humming the tune after him. Both were, no doubt,
ignorant of the nationality of the song, though not of the
truth of its sentiment.</p>

<p>In the course of one of my morning walks, I went to the
metropolitan abbey of Notre Dame, which is situated at the
end of a large island in the Seine, which forms a part of Paris,
and is filled with long narrow streets. It is a fine gothic
pile, but in my humble opinion, much inferior to our Westminster
abbey, and to the great churches of Rouen.</p>

<p>From this building I visited, with a large party, the celebrated
museum, or palace of the arts, which I afterwards generally
frequented every other day.</p>

<p>This inestimable collection contains one thousand and thirty
paintings, which are considered to be the chefs d'&#339;uvre of
the great ancient masters, and is a treasury of human art and
genius, unknown to the most renowned of former ages, and
far surpassing every other institution of the same nature, in the
present times.</p>

<p>The first apartment is about the size of the exhibition room<span class='pagenum'>107</span>
of Somerset house, and lighted as that is, from above. It
contains several exquisite paintings, which have been presented
to Bonaparte by the princes, and rulers of those states which
have been either subdued by his arms, or have cultivated his
alliance. The parisians call this apartment Bonaparte's nosegay.
The most costly pictures in the room, are from the gallery
of the grand duke of Tuscany. Amongst so many works,
all exquisite and beautiful, it is almost temerity to attempt to
select, but if I might be permitted to name those which pleased
me most, I should particularize the Ecce Homo, by Cigoli
Ludovico Cardi.</p>

<p>The breast of the mild and benevolent Saviour, striped with
the bruises of recent punishment, and his heavenly countenance,
benignly looking forgiveness upon his executioners,
are beautifully delineated. L'Annonciation, by Gentileschi,
in which the divine look of the angel, the graceful plumage
of his wings, and the drapery of the virgin, are incomparable.
La Sagesse chassant les Vices, which is a very ancient and curious
painting, by Andrea Mantegna, in which the figure of
Idleness, without arms, is wonderfully conceived. Les Noces
de Cana, by Paul Veronese, which is considered to be the best
of his works. It is the largest painting I ever beheld. The
figures which are seated at the banquet, are chiefly the portraits
of contemporary royal personages of different nations.
From this room we passed into the gallery of the Louvre.</p>

<p>I cannot adequately describe the first impressions which
were awakened, upon my first entering it, and contemplating
such a galaxy of art and genius. This room is one thousand<span class='pagenum'>108</span>
two hundred feet long, and is lined with the finest paintings
of the french, flemish, and italian schools, and is divided by
a curious double painting upon slate, placed upon a pedestal
in the middle of the room, which represents the front and back
view of the same figures.</p>

<p>The first division of this hall contains the finest works of
le Brun, many of which are upon an immense scale.
L'Hyver ou le Deluge, by Poussin, is truly sublime, but is
unfortunately placed in a bad light. There are also some
beautiful marine paintings, by Verney. Les Religieuses, by
Philipe de Champagne, is justly celebrated for the principal
figure of the dying nun. Vue de Chevet d'une eglise, by
Emanuel de Witte, is an exquisite little cabinet picture, in
which the effect of a ray of light shining through a painted
window, upon a column, is inimitable, and the perspective is
very fine. There are here also some of the finest works of
Wouvermans, and a charming picture by Teniers. La Vierge,
l'enfant Jesus, la Madeleine, et St. Jerome, by Antoine
Allegri Correge, is considered to be a picture of great beauty
and value. There are also some glorious paintings by Reubens.
I have thus briefly selected these pictures from the rest,
hoping, at the same time, that it will not be inferred that
those which I have not named, of which it would be impossible
to offer a description without filling a bulky volume, are
inferior to the works which I have presumed to mention.
The recording pen must rival that matchless pencil, which has
thus adorned the walls of the Museum, before it can do justice
to such a magnificent collection.<span class='pagenum'>109</span></p>

<p>This exhibition is public three days in the week, and at
other times is open to students and to strangers, upon their
producing their passports. On public days, all descriptions
of persons are here to be seen. The contemplation of such a
mixture is not altogether uninteresting.</p>

<p>The sun-browned rugged plebeian, whose mind, by the influence
of an unexampled political change, has been long
alienated from all the noble feelings which religion and humanity
inspire, is here seen, with his arms rudely folded over his
breast, softening into pity, before the struggling and sinking
sufferers of a deluged world, or silently imbibing from the
divine resigned countenance of the crucified Saviour, a hope
of unperishable bliss, beyond the grave. Who will condemn
a policy by which ignorance becomes enlightened, profligacy
penitent, and which, as by stealth, imparts to the relenting
bosom of ferocity the subdued, and social dispositions of <i>true</i>
fraternity?</p>

<p>To amuse, may be necessary to the present government of
France, but surely to supplant the wild abandoned principles
of a barbarous revolution, with <i>new</i> impressions, created by an
unreserved display of the finest and most persuasive images
of resigned suffering, heroic virtue, or elegant beauty, cannot
be deemed unworthy of the ruler of a great people.</p>

<p>At this place, as well as at all the other national exhibitions,
no money for admission is required or expected. No person
is admitted with a stick, and guards attend to preserve the
pictures from injury, and the exhibition from riot. The gallery
of the Louvre is at present, unfortunately, badly lighted<span class='pagenum'>110</span>
throughout, owing to the light issuing chiefly on one side,
from long windows. This inconvenience, however, is soon to
be remedied; by observing the same manner of lighting, as in
the adjoining apartment.</p>

<p>From the museum, we descended into la Salle des Antiques,
which contains all the treasury of grecian and roman statuary.
The first object to which we hastened, was the statue of
Laocoon, for so many ages, and by so many writers admired
and celebrated. This superb specimen of grecian sculpture,
is supposed to be the united production of Polydorus, Athenodorus,
and Agesander, but its great antiquity renders its history
somewhat dubious. In the beginning of the sixteenth century
it was discovered at Rome amongst the ruins of the palace of
Titus, and deposited in the Farnese palace, whence it has
been removed to Paris, by the orders of Bonaparte, after the
conquest of Italy. It represents Laocoon, the priest of Apollo
and Neptune, and his two sons writhing in the folds of two
hideous serpents. The reader will remember the beautiful lines
of Virgil upon the subject,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;et primum parva duorum</span>
<span class="i0">Corpora natorum serpens amplexus uterque</span>
<span class="i0">Implicat, et miseros morsu depascitur artus.</span>
<span class="i0">Post, ipsum auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem</span>
<span class="i0">Corripiunt, spirisque ligant ingentibus: et jam</span>
<span class="i0">Bis medium amplexi, bis collo squamea circum</span>
<span class="i0">Terga dati, superant capite et cervicibus altis.</span>
<span class="i0">Ille simul manibus tendit divellere nodos&mdash;"</span>
<span class='pagenum'>111</span></div></div>

<p>Or, in the english habit which Dryden has given them,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And first around the tender boys they wind,</span>
<span class="i0">Then with their sharpen'd fangs, their limbs and bodies grind.</span>
<span class="i0">The wretched father, running to their aid,</span>
<span class="i0">With pious haste, but vain, they next invade:</span>
<span class="i0">Twice round his waist the winding volumes roll'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And twice about his gasping throat they fold.</span>
<span class="i0">The priest, thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,</span>
<span class="i0">And tow'ring o'er his head in triumphs ride.</span>
<span class="i0">With both his hands he labours at the knots&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Pliny mentions this statue as the admiration of the age in
which he flourished.</p>

<p>I fear that I shall be guilty of a sort of profanation when
I remark, that the figures of the two sons of Laocoon appear
to exhibit rather more marks of maturity, and strength of
muscle than are natural to their size, and to the supposed tenderness
of their age. It is, however, a glorious work of art.</p>

<p>We next beheld the Belvidere Apollo. This statue, in my
humble opinion, surpasses every other in the collection. All
the divinity of a god beams through this unrivalled perfection
of form. It is impossible to impart the impressions which it
inspires. The rivetted beholder is ready to exclaim, with
Adam, when he first discerns the approach of Raphael,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;behold what glorious shape</span>
<span class="i0">Comes this way moving: seems another morn,</span>
<span class="i0">Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heav'n."</span>
<span class='pagenum'>112</span></div></div>

<p>The imagination cannot form such an union of grace and
strength. During my stay in Paris, I frequently visited this
distinguished statue, and discovered fresh subjects of amazement,
and admiration as often as I gazed upon it. One
of its remarkable beauties, is its exquisite expression of motion.
Its aerial appearance perpetually excites the idea of its
being unstationary, and unsupported. As it would be a rash,
and vain attempt to give a complete description of this
matchless image, I must, reluctantly, leave it, to inform my
reader, that on the other side of the Hall are the original
Diana (which is wonderfully fine) and several very beautiful
Venuses. The Venus de Medicis is not here. There are
also some fine whole length statues of roman magistrates,
in their curule chairs.</p>

<p>In the Temple of the Muses, are exquisite busts of
Homer and Socrates. Pliny informs us that the ancient
world possessed no original bust of the former. That of
the latter seems to have been chisseled to represent the celebrated
athenian before he had obtained his philosophical
triumph over those vices, which a distinguished physiognomist
of his time once imputed to him from the character of
his features.<span class='pagenum'>113</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Bonaparte.&mdash;Artillery.&mdash;Mr. Pitt&mdash;Newspapers.&mdash;Archbishop of
Paris.&mdash;Consular Colours.&mdash;Religion.&mdash;Consular Conversion.&mdash;Madame
Bonaparte.&mdash;Consular Modesty.&mdash;Separate Beds.&mdash;A

<p>A little anecdote is related of Bonaparte, which unfolded the
bold, and daring character of this extraordinary man in early
life: when he was about fifteen years of age, and a cadet in
the military school at Paris&mdash;by the by, the small distance between
this seminary and his present palace, and the swiftness
of his elevation, afford a curious coincidence&mdash;in the
vast plain of the Champ de Mars, the court, and the parisians
were assembled to witness the ascent of a balloon. Bonaparte
made his way through the crowd, and unperceived, entered
the inner fence, which contained the apparatus for inflating the
silken globe. It was then very nearly filled, and restrained
from its flight by the last cord only. The young cadet requested
the aeronaut to permit him to mount the car with him;
which request was immediately refused, from an apprehension
that the feelings of the boy might embarrass the experiment.
Bonaparte is reported to have exclaimed, "I am young, it is
true, but I neither fear the powers of earth, nor of air," and
sternly added, "will you let me ascend?" The aeronaut, a
little offended at his obtrusion, sharply replied, "No, Sir,
I will not; I beg that you will retire." Upon which the<span class='pagenum'>114</span>
little enraged officer, drew a small sabre, which he wore with
his uniform, instantly cut the balloon in several places, and
destroyed the curious apparatus, which the aeronaut had constructed,
with infinite labour and ingenuity, for the purpose
of trying the possibility of aerial navigation.</p>

<p>Paris was almost unpeopled this day, to view the spectacle.
The disappointment of the populace, which was said
to have exceeded seven hundred thousand persons, became
violent and universal. The king sent to know the reason of
the tumult, when the story was related to him, the good humoured
monarch laughed heartily, and said, "Upon my word
that impetuous boy, will make a brave officer."&mdash;The devoted
king little thought that he was speaking of his successor.&mdash;The
young offender was put under arrest, and confined for
four days.</p>

<p>This man is certainly the phenomenon of the present
times. It is a circumstance worthy of remark, that the artillery
has furnished France with most of its present distinguished
heroes, who have also been bred up in the same military school
with Bonaparte. A short time before my arrival at Paris, this
great genius, who displays a perfect knowledge of mankind, and
particularly of the people over whom he rules, discovered that the
parisians, from a familiarity with his person, and from his lady
and his family having occasionally joined in their parties of
amusement, began to lose that degree of awe and respect for
him, which he so well knows how to appreciate, as well as
to inspire. In consequence of this, he gradually retired from
every circle of fashion, and was at this period, almost as in<span class='pagenum'>115</span>accessible
as a chinese emperor. The same line of conduct
was also adopted by the principal officers of government.
He resided almost wholly at Mal Maison, except on state days,
when only those strangers were permitted to be introduced to
him, who had satisfired the ambassadors of their respective
nations, that they had been previously presented at their own
courts. If Bonaparte is spared from the stroke of the assassin,
or the pr&aelig;torian caprice of the army, for any length
of time, he will have it in his power to augment the services
which he has already afforded to the republic, by rebuilding
the political edifice of France, with many meliorations,
for which some materials may be collected from her own
ruins, and some from the tried and approved constitutions of
other countries. If his ambition will permit him to discharge
this great undertaking faithfully, in a manner uniform with
that glory which he has acquired in the field, and influenced
only by the noble desire of giving rational liberty, and practicable
happiness to the people over whom he sways, they
will in return, without jealousy or regret, behold the being
to whose wisdom and moderation they will be thus indebted,
led to the highest seat amongst them&mdash;they will
confer those sanctions upon his well merited distinction,
without which all authority is but disastrous usurpation&mdash;a
comet's blaze, flaming in a <i>night of dismay</i>, and <i>setting in
gloom</i>.</p>

<p>The dignity of such a legislator will be self-maintained,
and lasting. Upon him, the grateful french will confer
those unforced, unpurchased suffrages, which will <i>prevent</i> that<span class='pagenum'>116</span>
fate, which, in their absence, the subtilty of policy, the
fascinations of address, the charm of corruption, and even
the terror of the bayonet can only <i>postpone</i>.&mdash;Yes, Bonaparte!
millions of suffering beings, raising themselves from
the dust, in which a barbarous revolution has prostrated them,
look up to thee for liberty, protection, and repose. They
<i>will</i> not look to thee in vain. The retiring storm still flashing
its lessening flame, and rolling its distant thunders will teach
thee, <i>were it necessary</i>, not to force them to remeasure
their vengeance by their wrongs.</p>

<p>In Paris, the achievements of the first consul are not much
talked of, so true is the old adage, that no man is a hero
to his own domestic. The beauties of a colossal statue, must
be contemplated at a distance.</p>

<p>The french at present work, walk, eat, drink, and sleep
in tranquillity, and what is of more consequence to them,
they dance in security, to which may be added, that their
taxes are neither very heavy, nor oppressive. In every party
which I entered, I found the late minister of Great Britain
was the prevailing subject of curiosity. I was overpowered
with questions respecting this great man, which in their minute
detail, extended to ascertain what was the colour of his
eye, the shape of his nose, and whether in a morning he
wore hussar boots, or shoes. This little circumstance could
not fail of proving pleasant to an englishman. They informed
me, that throughout the war, they regularly read in their
own diurnal prints, our parliamentary debates, and the general
outline of most of our political schemes, which were<span class='pagenum'>117</span>
furnished by people in the pay of the french government,
who resided in England notwithstanding the severity of the
legislative, and the vigilance of the executive authorities.
Whilst I am mentioning the subject of newspaper intercourse,
I cannot help lamenting, that since the renewal of
national friendship, the public prints of both countries are
not more under the influence of cordiality and good
humour.</p>

<p>The liberty of the press is the palladium of reason, the distributor
of light and learning, the public and undismayed
assertor of interdicted truth. It is the body and the <i>honour
guard</i> of civil and political liberty. Where the laws halt
with dread, the freedom of the press advances, and with the
subtle activity of conscience, penetrates the fortified recesses
and writes its <i>fearful sentence on the palace wall</i> of recoiling
tyrants. As an englishman, my expiring sigh should be
breathed for its preservation; but as an admirer of social
repose and national liberality, I regret to see its noble energies
engaged in the degrading service of fretful spleen, and
ungenerous animadversion. When the horizon is no longer
blackened with the smoke of the battle, it is unworthy of two
mighty empires to carry on an ignoble war of words. If
peace is their wish, let them manifest the great and enlightened
sentiment in all its purity, and disdain to irritate each
other by acts of petulant and provoking recrimination.</p>

<p>A short time preceding my arrival in France, Bonaparte
had rendered himself very popular amongst the constitutional
clergy, by a well timed compliment to the metropo<span class='pagenum'>118</span>litan
archbishop. The first consul gave a grand dinner to
this dignified prelate, and to several of his brethren. After
the entertainment, Bonaparte addressed the archbishop by
observing, that as he had given directions for the repairing
of the archiepiscopal palace, he should very much like to
take a ride in the archbishop's carriage, to see the progress
which the workmen had made. The prelate bowed to the
first consul, and informed him that he had no carriage,
otherwise he should be much flattered by conducting him
thither. Bonaparte good humouredly said, "how can that
be? your coach has been waiting at the gate this half
hour," and immediately led the venerable archbishop down
the steps of the Thuilleries, where he found a plain handsome
carriage, with a valuable pair of horses, and a coachman,
and footmen dressed in the livery which Bonaparte
had just before informed him would be allotted to him,
when his establishment was completed. The whole was a
present from the private purse of the first consul. Upon
their arrival at the palace, the archbishop was agreeably surprised
by finding that the most minute, and liberal attention
had been paid to his comfort and accommodation.</p>

<p>The clergy seem to be in favour with Bonaparte. When
he assisted in the last spring at the inauguration of the
archbishop of Paris, in the metropolitan church of Notre
Dame, and gave to the restoration of religion "all the circumstance
of pomp" and military parade, he was desirous
of having the colours of his regiment consecrated by
the holy prelate, and submitted his wishes to his soldiers.<span class='pagenum'>119</span>
A few days afterwards, a deputation waited upon their general
in chief, with this reply, "Our banners have already been
consecrated by the blood of our enemies at Marengo;
the benediction of a priest cannot render them more sacred
in our eyes, nor more animating in the time of
battle." Bonaparte prudently submitted himself to their
pr&aelig;torian resolution, and the consular colours remain to this
hour in the same <i>unchristianlike</i> condition, as when they
first waved at the head of their victorious legions. This
anecdote will in some degree prove a fact which, notwithstanding
the counter reports of english newspapers, I found
every where confirmed, that although religion is <i>new</i> to the
french, yet that the novelty has at present but little charm
for them. I had frequent opportunity of making this remark,
as well in the capital as in the departments of the
republic through which I passed. In Paris, the Sabbath
can only be considered as a day of dissipation to the lovers
of gayety, and a day of unusual profit to the man of
trade. Here, it is true, upon particular festival days, considerable
bodies of people are to be seen in the act of worship,
but curiosity, and the love of show assemble them together,
if it was otherwise their attendance would be more
numerous and regular. The first consul does not seem to
possess much fashionable influence over the french in matters
of religion, otherwise, as he has the credit of attending
mass, with very pious punctuality, in his private chapel at
Mal Maison, it might be rather expected, that devotion
would become a little more familiar to the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>Upon another subject, the <span class="errata" title="profession"><i>will</i></span> of the chief magistrate
has been equally unfortunate. To the few ladies who
are admitted into his social circles, he has declared himself
an enemy to that dress, or undress (I am puzzled to know
what to call it) which his friend, David, has, so successfully,
recommended, for the purpose of displaying, with the
least possible restraint, the fine proportions of the female
form. Madame Bonaparte, who is considered to be in as
good a state of subordination to her <i>young</i> husband, as the
consular regiment is to their <i>young</i> general, contrives to exhibit
her elegant person to great advantage; by adopting a
judicious and graceful medium of dress, by which she tastefully
avoids a load of decoration, which repels the eye by
too dense a covering, and that questionable airiness of ornament
which, by its gracious and unrestrained display, deprives
the imagination of more than half its pleasures. Bonaparte
is said not to be indifferent to those affections which
do honour to the breast which cherishes them, nor to the
morals of the people whom he governs.</p>

<p>It is well known that in France, in the house of a new
fashionable couple, <i>separate chambers</i> are always reserved for
the <i>faithful</i> pair, which after the solemnities of marriage
very seldom remain long unoccupied. The first consul considers
such separations as unfriendly to morals. A few
months since, by a well timed display of assumed ignorance,
he endeavoured to give fashion to a sentiment which
may in time reduce the number of these <i>family accommodations</i>.
The noble palace of St. Cloud was at this time<span class='pagenum'>121</span>
preparing for him; the principal architect requested of him to
point out in what part of the palace he would wish to have his
separate sleeping room. "I do not know what you mean,"
said the young imperial philosopher, "crimes only divide
the husband from his wife. Make as many bed rooms as
you please, but only <i>one</i> for me and Madame Bonaparte."</p>

<p>I must now quit the dazzling splendour of imperial virtues
for the more tranquil, but not less fascinating appearance of
retired and modest merit.</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of one of the finest days in June, when
Madame O&mdash;&mdash;, with her nephew, a very amiable young man,
called in their carriage and took me to the chateau of
her husband, to whom I had letters of introduction. After
passing through a charming country for nine miles, adorned
on each side with gardens and country houses, we arrived at
the pleasant village of la Reine. As soon as we entered it,
the sight of the carriage, and of their benefactress, seemed
to enliven the faces of the villagers, who were seated in picturesque
groupes at the doors of their cottages. Such animated
looks were not lighted up by curiosity, for they had
seen Madame O&mdash;&mdash; a thousand and a thousand times, but
because they had seldom seen her without experiencing some
endearing proof of her bountiful heart. We left the village
to the right, and proceeded through a private road, lined
with stately walnut trees, of nearly a mile in length, which
led to Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;'s. It was evening; the sky was cloudless,
the sun was setting in great glory, and covered the face
of this romantic country with the richest glow. Near the<span class='pagenum'>122</span>
gate of a shrubbery I beheld a very handsome boy, whose
appearance at once bespoke him to be the son of a gentleman,
the animated smile of Madame O&mdash;&mdash;, immediately convinced
me that it was her son; "see," said the delighted mother, "it
is my little gardener;" the little graceful rustic had a small
spade in his hand, which he threw down, and ran to us.
We alighted at the entrance of the garden, into which we
entered, under a beautiful covered treillage, lined with jessamine
and honeysuckles. At the end were two elegant young
women, waiting, with delight, to receive their mother, from
whom they had been separated only a few hours. With this
charming family I entered the house, which was handsome
but plain. The hospitable owner rose from his sofa, and, after
embracing his elegant lady with great affection, he received
me with all the expressions and warmth of a long friendship.
Soon afterwards his servant (a faithful indian) entered, and
spread upon the table, Madeira, Burgundy, and dried fruits.
It was intensely hot: the great window at the end of the
room in which we were sitting, opened into the gardens,
which appeared to be very beautiful, and abounded with
nightingales, which were then most sweetly singing. "They
are my little musicians," said Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;, "we have
made a pleasant bargain together, I give them crumbs of
bread and my bowers to range in, and they give me this
charming music every evening."</p>

<p>Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; was an invalide, the revolution, poignant
vexations, heavy losses, and a painful separation from his
native country, for the preservation of his life, and that of his<span class='pagenum'>123</span>
family, had undermined his health. Grief had made sad
inroads upon a delicate constitution. It was his good fortune
to be the husband of one of the finest, and most amiable
women in France, and the father of an affectionate, beautiful,
and accomplished family. His circumstances had been
once splendid; they were then respectable, but he had passed
through events which threatened his <i>all</i>. Those sufferings
which generous souls sustain for the sake of others, not for
themselves, had alone destroyed the resemblance which once
existed between this excellent man and his admirable portrait,
which, at the further end of the room, presented the healthy
glow, and fine proportions of manly beauty. He expressed
to me, in the most charming manner, his regret, that indisposition
confined him to the country, and prevented him from
receiving me in Paris suitable to his own wishes, and to those
claims which I had upon his attentions, by the letters of introduction
which I had brought to him; but added, that he
should furnish me with letters to some of his friends in town,
who would be happy to supply his absence, and to make Paris
agreeable to me. Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; was as good as his word.</p>

<p>This amiable gentleman possessed a countenance of great
genius, and a mind full of intelligence.</p>

<p>After an elegant supper, when his lady and daughters had
withdrawn, he entered into a very interesting account of his
country, of the revolution, and of his flight for the salvation
of himself and family. A tolerably good opinion may be
formed of the devastation which have been produced by the
late republican government, by the following circumstance,<span class='pagenum'>124</span>
which Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; assured me, on the word of a man of
honour, was correct.</p>

<p>His section in Paris was composed of one thousand three
hundred persons, of rank and fortune, of whom only five had
escaped the slaughter of the guillotine!!</p>

<p>Madame O&mdash;&mdash; and her charming family, seemed wholly to
occupy his heart and affections.</p>

<p>He spoke of his lady with all the tender eulogium of a
young lover. Their union was entirely from attachment, and
had been resisted on the part of Madame O&mdash;&mdash;, when he first
addressed her, only because her fortune was humble, compared
with his. He informed me, and I must not suppress
the story, that in the time of blood, this amiable woman,
who is remarkable for the delicacy of her mind, and for the
beauty and majesty of her person, displayed a degree of coolness
and courage, which, in the field of battle, would have
covered the hero with laurels. One evening, a short period
before the family left France, a party of those murderers,
who were sent for by Robespierre, from the frontiers which
divide France from Italy, and who were by that archfiend
employed in all the butcheries, and massacres of Paris, entered
the peaceful village of la Reine, in search of Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;.
His lady saw them advancing, and anticipating their errand,
had just time to give her husband intelligence of their approach,
who left his chateau by a back door, and secreted himself in
the house of a neighbour. Madame O&mdash;&mdash;, with perfect
composure, went out to meet them, and received them in the
most gracious manner. They sternly demanded Mons. O&mdash;&mdash;,<span class='pagenum'>125</span>
she informed them that he had left the country, and after
engaging them in conversation, she conducted them into her
drawing room, and regaled them with her best wines, and
made her servants attend upon them with unusual deference
and ceremony. Their appearance was altogether horrible,
they wore leather aprons, which were sprinkled all over with
blood, they had large horse pistols in their belts, and a dirk
and sabre by their sides. Their looks were full of ferocity,
and they spoke a harsh dissonant patois language. Over their
cups, they talked about the bloody business of that day's occupation,
in the course of which they drew out their dirks, and
wiped from their handles, clots of blood and hair. Madame
O&mdash;&mdash; sat with them, undismayed by their frightful deportment.
After drinking several bottles of Champaign and Burgundy,
these savages began to grow good humoured, and seemed
to be completely fascinated by the amiable and unembarrassed,
and hospitable behaviour of their fair landlady. After carousing
till midnight, they pressed her to retire, observing that
they had been received so handsomely that they were convinced
Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; had been misrepresented, and was
no enemy to the <i>good cause</i>; they added that they found the
wines excellent, and after drinking two or three bottles more,
they would leave the house, without causing her any reason to
regret their admission.</p>

<p>Madame O&mdash;&mdash;, with all the appearance of perfect tranquillity
and confidence in their promises, wished her unwelcome
visitors a good night, and after visiting her children in
their rooms, she threw herself upon her bed, with a loaded<span class='pagenum'>126</span>
pistol in each hand, and, overwhelmed with suppressed agony
and agitation, she <i>soundly</i> slept till she was called by her
servants, two hours after these wretches had left the house.
He related also another instance of that resolution which is
not unfrequently exhibited by women, when those generous
affections, for which they are so justly celebrated, are menaced
with danger. About the same period, two of the children
of Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; were in Paris at school: A rumour had
reached him, that the teachers of the seminary in which
they were placed, had offended the government, and were
likely to be butchered, and that the carnage which was expected
to take place, might, in its undistinguishing fury, extend
to the pupils. Immediately upon receiving this intelligence,
Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; ordered his carriage, for the purpose
of proceeding to town. Madame O&mdash;&mdash; implored of him to
permit her to accompany him; in vain did he beseech her
to remain at home; the picture of danger which he painted,
only rendered her more determined. She mounted the carriage,
and seated herself by the side of her husband. When
they reached Paris, they were stopped in the middle of the
street St. Honor&eacute;, by the massacre of a large number of
prisoners who had just been taken out of a church which
had been converted into a prison. Their ears were pierced
with screams. Many of the miserable victims were cut down,
clinging to the windows of their carriage. During the dreadful
delays which they suffered in passing through this street,
Madame O&mdash;&mdash; discovered no sensations of alarm, but stedfastly
fixed her eyes upon the back of the coach box, to avoid,<span class='pagenum'>127</span>
as much as possible, observing the butcheries which were perpetrating
on each side of her.</p>

<p>Had she been observed to close her eyes, or to set back in
the carriage, she would have excited a suspicion, which, no
doubt, would have proved fatal to her. At length she reached
the school which contained her children, where she found
the rumour which they had received was without foundation;
she calmly conducted them to the carriage, and during their
gloomy return through Paris, betrayed no emotions; but as
soon as they had passed the barrier, and were once more in
safety upon the road to their peaceful chateau, the exulting
mother, in an agony of joy, pressed her children to her bosom,
and in a state of mind wrought up to frenzy, arrived at her
own house, in convulsions of ghastly laughter. Monsieur
O&mdash;&mdash; never spoke of this charming woman, without exhibiting
the strongest emotions of regard. He said, that in sickness
she suffered no one to attend upon him but herself, that in all
his afflictions she had supported him, and that she mitigated
the deep melancholy which the sufferings of his country, and
his own privations, had fixed upon him, by the well-timed
sallies of her elegant fancy, or by the charms of her various
accomplishments.</p>

<p>I found myself a gainer in the article of delight, by leaving
the gayest metropolis that Europe can present to a traveller,
for the sake of visiting such a family.<span class='pagenum'>128</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Breakfast.&mdash;Warmth of French Expression.&mdash;Rustic Eloquence.&mdash;Curious
Cause assigned for the late extraordinary Frost.&mdash;Madame
R&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;Paul I.&mdash;Tivoli.&mdash;Frescati.</i></p></div>


<p>In the morning we breakfasted in the drawing room, in
which the murderous myrmidons of Robespierre had been
regaled. It was beautifully situated. Its windows looked into
a grove which Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; had formed of valuable
american shrubs. His youngest daughter, a beautiful little
girl of about five years of age, rather hastily entered the
room with a pair of tame wood pigeons in her hands, which,
in her eagerness to bring to her father, she had too forcibly
pressed, who very gently told her, it was cruel to hurt her
little favourites, more particularly as they were a species of
bird which was remarkable for its unoffending innocence.
The little creature burst into tears, "my little Harriet, why
do you weep?" said her father, kissing her white forehead,
and pressing her to him. "Why do you rebuke me?" said
the little sufferer, "when you know I love you so much that I
could kiss your naked heart."</p>

<p>I mention this circumstance, to show how early in life,
the french children imbibe the most charming expressions, by
which their more mature conversation is rendered so peculiarly
captivating. During our repast, a circumstance occurred,
which produced an unusual vivacity amongst all the party,<span class='pagenum'>129</span>
and afforded a specimen of the talent and pleasantry of the
french country people. The gardener entered, with the paper,
and letters of the day. Amongst them, was a letter which had
been opened, appeared very much disordered, and ought to
have been received upon the preceding day. Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;
seemed much displeased, and called upon his man to explain
the matter. The gardener, who possessed a countenance
which beamed with animation and good humour, made a low
bow, and without appearing to be, in the least degree, disconcerted,
proceeded to unfold the affair, with the most playful
ingenuity. He stated that the dairy maid was very pretty,
that she made every body in love with her, and was very
much in love herself, that she was accustomed to receive a
great number of billet doux, which, on account of her education
having been very far below her incomparable merits,
she was not able to understand, without the assistance of
Nicolene, the groom, who was her confident, and amanuensis;
that on the day before, he gave her the letter in
question, with directions to carry it to his master, that under
the influence of that thoughtful absence which is said to
attend the advanced stages of the tender passion, she soon
afterwards conceived that it was no other than a customary
homage from one of her many admirers, upon which she
committed the supposed depositary of tender sighs and brittle
vows, to the warm custody of her glowing bosom, than which,
the gardener, (who at this moment saw his master's eyes
were engaged by the <i>sullied</i> appearance of the letter) declared
that nothing was fairer; he again proceeded, by observing,<span class='pagenum'>130</span>
that in the course of the preceding evening, as she was stooping
to adjust her stool in the meadow, the cow kicked, and
the epistle tumbled into the milk pail; that she afterwards
dried it by the kitchen fire, and gave it, for the reasons before
assigned, to her confidential friend to explain to her, who
soon discovered it to be a letter of business, addressed to his
master, instead of an impassioned love ditty for the tender
Marie; that, finally, all the principals concerned in this unhappy
affair were overwhelmed with distress, on account of the
sad disaster, and that the kitchen had lost all its vivacity ever
since. No advocate could have pleaded more eloquently. All
the family, from its chief, to little Harriet, whose tears were
not yet dried, were in a continued fit of laughing. The gardener,
whose face very largely partook of the gaiety which
he had so successfully excited, was commissioned, by his amiable
master, to tell the distressed dairy maid, that love always
carried his pardon in his hand for all his offences, and that
he cheerfully forgave her, but directed the gardener, to prevent
a recurrence of similar accidents, not again to trust her with
his letters until the tender disease was radically removed.
The rustic orator gracefully bowed; and left us to finish our
breakfast with increased good humour, and to carry forgiveness
and consolation to poor Marie and all her condoling friends
in the kitchen. Before we had completed our repast, a little
deformed elderly lady made her appearance, whose religion
had been shaken by the revolution, into a crazy and gloomy
superstition. She had scarcely seated herself, before she began
a very rapid and voluble comment upon the change of the<span class='pagenum'>131</span>
times, and the devastations which the late extraordinary frost
had committed upon the vineyards of France, which she positively
asserted, with the confidence which only the arrival
of her tutelar saint with the intelligence ought to have inspired,
was sent as an <i>appropriate</i> judgment upon the republic,
to punish it, for suffering the ladies of Paris to go so thinly
clothed. Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; heard her very patiently throughout,
and then observed, that the ways of Heaven were inscrutable,
that human ingenuity was baffled, in attempting to
draw inferences from its visitations, and that it did not appear
to him at least, that an offence which was assuredly calculated
to inspire sensations of warmth and tenderness, was <i>appropriately</i>
punished by a chastisement of an <i>opposite</i> tendency,
to which he added, that some moralists who indulged in an
endeavour to connect causes and effects, might think it rather
incompatible with their notions of eternal equity, to endeavour
to clothe the ladies, by stripping the land to nakedness&mdash;here
the old lady could not help smiling. Her amicable adversary
pursued the advantage which his pleasantry had produced,
by informing her, that prognostications had been for a long
period discountenanced, and that formerly when the ancient
augurs, after the ceremonies of their successful illusions were
over, met each other by accident in the street, impressed by
the ridiculous remembrance of their impositions, they could
not help laughing in each other's faces. Madame V&mdash;&mdash;
laughed too; upon which Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;, very good humouredly
told her, that as a soothsayer, she certainly would
not have smiled, unless she intended to retire for ever from<span class='pagenum'>132</span>
the office. Previous to my taking leave of Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash;
and his charming family, we walked in the gardens, where
our conversation turned upon the extraordinary genius, who
in the character of first consul of the french, unites a force,
and extent of sway unknown to the kings of France, from
their first appearance, to the final extinction of monarchy.</p>

<p>He told me that he had the honour of knowing him with
intimacy from his youth, and extolled, with high eulogy, his
splendid abilities, and the great services which he had rendered
France. He also related several amiable anecdotes of
the minister Talleyrand, who, when in America, had lived
with him a considerable time under the same roof.</p>

<p>At length the cabriolet, which was to bear me from this
little Paradise, approached the gate, and the moment arrived
when I was to part with one of the most charming families to
be found in the bosom of the republic.</p>

<p>As Monsieur O&mdash;&mdash; pressed me by one hand, and placed
that of his little Harriet in my other, a tear of exquisite tenderness
rolled down his cheek, it seemed to express that we
should never meet again on this side the grave. Excellent
being! if it must be so, if wasting and unsparing sickness is
destined to tear thee ere long from those who delight thine
eye, and soothe thine heart in the midst of its sorrows, may
the angel of peace smile upon thee in thy last moments, and
bear thy mild and generous, and patient spirit, to the realms of
eternal repose! Adieu! dear family of la Reine.</p>

<p>Upon my return to Paris, I proceeded to the hotel of
Monsieur R&mdash;&mdash;. Curiosity led me to view the house,<span class='pagenum'>133</span>
and the celebrated bed of his lady, who was then in
London.</p>

<p>The little vanities and eccentricities of this elegant and
hospitable woman, will find immediate forgiveness, when it is
known that she is now very young, and was married, when a
spoiled child of the age of fourteen, to her present husband.
She is one of David's most enthusiastic admirers, and has
carried the rage for grecian undress, to an extremity, which,
even in the capital, left her without a follower.</p>

<p>In the public walks of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, she one evening
presented herself in a dress which almost rivalled the robes of
Paradise; the parisians, who are remarkable for their politeness
to women, and are not remarkable for scrupulous sentiments
of delicacy, were so displeased with her appearance, that they
made a lane to the entrance for her, and expelled the modern
Eve from the Elysian Fields, not with a "flaming sword of
wrath," but with hisses softly uttered, and by gentle tokens
of polite disapprobation. She tells her friends, that her cabinet
is crowded with letters of the most impassioned love, from
persons of the first fame, distinction, and opulence. In her
parties, when conversation begins to pause, she introduces
some of these melting epistles, which she is said to read with
a bewitching pathos, and never fails to close the fond recital
by expressions of the tenderest pity for the sufferings of their
ill-starred authors. She has declared, that some of her lovers
equal the Belvidere Apollo in beauty, but that she never has
yet seen that being, who was perfect enough to be entitled to
the possession of her affections. Do not smile. Madame R<span class='pagenum'>134</span>is
a disciple of Diana, even slander pays incessant homage to
her chastity. Rumour has whispered, in every corner of Paris,
that her husband is only admitted to the honour of supplying
the finances of her splendid and costly establishment. Madame
R&mdash;&mdash; has not yet produced any of the beautiful and
eloquent arguments of Cornelia, to disprove the strange assertion.
Her chamber, which constitutes one of the sights of
Paris, and which, after what has been just mentioned, may be
justly considered, in or out of France, as a great curiosity, is
fitted up in a style of considerable taste, and even magnificence.
The bed upon which this charming statue reposes, is
a superb sofa, raised upon a pedestal, the ascent to which is
by a flight of cedar steps, on each side are altars, on which
are placed Herculaneum vases of flowers, and a large antique
lamp of gold; the back of the bed is formed by an immense
pier glass, and the curtains, which are of the most costly
muslin, festooned with golden tassels, descend in beautiful
drapery from a floral crown of gold. It is said that the late
emperor of Russia, after the laborious and successful diplomatic
intrigues of messrs. Talleyrand and Sieyes, and a certain
lady, became enamoured, by description, with the immaculate
goddess of Mont Blanc, and that he sent confidential commissioners
to Paris, to report her daily dress, and to order copies
of her furniture.</p>

<p>The story may be believed, when the hero of it was well
known to be fully qualified for one of the deepest dungeons
of a madhouse. I hope, for the sake of society, and the
repose of the world, that the rest of Madame R&mdash;&mdash;'s admirers<span class='pagenum'>135</span>
have not united to their passion the bewildered imagination,
which fatally distinguished, and finally closed the career of
her imperial lover.</p>

<p>Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; is very polite to the english, and his letters
ensure the greatest attention wherever they are produced.</p>

<p>From Mont Blanc I proceeded to the Hotel de Caramand,
the residence of the british ambassador, to whom I had
a letter of introduction, from a particular friend of his, and
who received me with great politeness. His apartments were
handsome, and looked into some beautiful gardens. Amongst
the english, who were at this time in Paris, a little prejudice
existed against the representative of the british monarch,
from a reason, which within the jurisdiction of the lord
mayor of London and of most corporate towns in England,
will be considered to carry considerable weight. The
envoy did not celebrate the late birthday of his sovereign
by a jolly, and convivial dinner. The fact was, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;,
who by the sudden return of Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, became unexpectedly
invested with the dignity of an ambassador, was
in constant expectation of being recalled, to make room for
the intended appointment of lord W&mdash;&mdash; to the consular
court, in consequence of which, he had not prepared for
the display of those splendid hospitalities, which, on such
occasions, always distinguish the table of a british house of
embassy.</p>

<p>On a Sunday evening, I went with a party to Tivoli, a
favourite place of amusement with the parisians. At the entrance
we found, as at all the public places, a guard of<span class='pagenum'>136</span>
horse, and foot. The admission is twenty sols. The evening
was very fine. We passed immense crowds of people,
who were flocking to the same place. Amongst them were
many elegant, well dressed women, wholly unattended by
gentlemen, a circumstance by no means unusual in Paris.
This place seemed to be raised by the magic touch of enchantment.
We entered upon gravelled walks, which were
cut through little winding, and intersecting hillocks of box;
those which formed the sides were surmounted by orange
trees, which presented a beautiful colonnade; immediately
after we had passed them, we entered an elegant treillage
of honeysuckles, roses, and eglantine, which formed the
grand entrance to the garden. Here a most animated scene
of festivity opened upon us. On one side were rope
dancers, people riding at the ring, groups of persons playing
at shuttlecock, which seemed to be the favourite, and I
may add, the most ridiculous diversion; on the other side,
were dancers, tumblers, mountebanks, and parties, all with
gay countenances, seated in little bowers enjoying lemonade,
and ices. In the centre as we advanced, were about three
hundred people, who were dancing the favourite waltz. This
dance was brought from Germany, where, <i>from its nature</i>,
the partners are always engaged lovers; but the french, who
think that nothing can be blamable which is susceptible of
elegance, have introduced the german dance, without adhering
to the german regulation. The attitudes of the
waltz are very graceful, but they would not altogether accord
with english female notions of delicacy. At a late<span class='pagenum'>137</span>
fashionable parisian ball, a gentleman present was requested
by the lady of the house, to waltz with a friend of hers,
who was without a partner. The person of this neglected
fair, was a little inclined to the meagre. The gallant, without
the least embarrassment, declined, observing, "Ah! ma
chere Madame qu'exigez vous de moi, ne savez vous pas
qu'elle n'a point de sein?" In the middle of the platform
of the dancers, a very fine full band was playing. At
the end of this raised stage, a very capacious indian marquee
was erected, which was beautifully illuminated with variegated
lamps, and under its broad canopy, a large concourse
of people was seated, some were enjoying conversation,
some were playing at buillotte, drinking coffee, &amp;c.; behind
this building, was a noble corinthian temple, from the
doors of which, were covered trellis walks, leading to spacious
gardens, which were formed to display the different
tastes of the english, french, and dutch nations, whose respective
names they bore. These gardens are intersected by
little canals, upon which several persons were amusing
themselves with the diversion of canoe racing. The whole
was illuminated by large patent reflecting lamps, which shed
a lustre almost as brilliant as the day. A few english were
present, amongst them were the duchess of Cumberland,
and a few other ladies. These gardens, previous to the revolution,
were the property of a wealthy minister of France,
who, it is said, expended near one hundred thousand
pounds sterling, in bringing them to perfection, which he
just saw accomplished, when he closed his eyes upon<span class='pagenum'>138</span>
the scaffold. The nation became their next proprietor, who
sold them for a large sum of money to their present
owners.</p>

<p>From this place we went to Frescati, which is the promenade
of the first beauty, and fashion of Paris, who generally
assemble about half past ten o'clock, after the opera is
concluded. No admission money is required, but singular as it
may seem, no improper intruder has yet appeared, a circumstance
which may be accounted for by the awe which well bred
society ever maintains over vulgarity. Frescati is situated in
the Italian Boulevard; was formerly the residence of a nobleman
of large fortune, and has also undergone the usual
transition of revolutionary confiscation. The streets leading
to it were filled with carriages. After ascending a flight
of steps, from a handsome court yard, we entered a beautiful
hall, which was lined with pier glasses, and decorated
with festoons of artificial flowers, at the end of it was a
fine statue of Venus de Medicis. On one side of this image
was an arch, which led into a suite of six magnificent apartments,
which were superbly gilt, painted, and also covered
with pier glasses, and lustres of fine diamond cut glass,
which latter, looked like so many little glittering cascades.
Each room was in a blaze of light, and filled with
parties, who were taking ices, or drinking coffee. Each
room communicated with the others, by arches, or folding
doors of mirrors. The garden is small, but very tastefully
disposed. It is composed of three walks, which are lined
with orange and acacia trees, and vases of roses. At the<span class='pagenum'>139</span>
end is a tower mounted on a rock, temples, and rustic
bridges; and on each side of the walks, are little labyrinth
bowers. On the side next to the Boulevard, is a terrace
which commands the whole scene, is lined on each
side with beautiful vases of flowers, and is terminated at
each end by alcoves, which are lined with mirrors. Here
in the course of an hour, the astonished, and admiring
stranger may see near three thousand females of the first
beauty and distinction in Paris, whose cheeks are no longer
disfigured by the corrosion of rouge, and who, by their
symmetry and grace, would induce him to believe, that the
loveliest figures of Greece, in her proudest era, were revived,
and moving before him.<span class='pagenum'>140</span></p>

Family.</i></p></div>


<p>The english convent, or as it is called, the convent of
blue nuns, in the Rue de St. Victoire, is the only establishment
of the kind, which throughout the republic, has survived
the revolution. To what cause its exclusive protection
is attributable, is not, I believe correctly known. But
though this spot of sacred seclusion, has escaped the final
stroke of extermination, it has sustained an ample share
of the general desolation. During the time of terrour, it
was converted into the crowded prison of the female nobility,
who were here confined, and afterwards dragged from
its cloisters, and butchered by the guillotine, or the daggers
of assassins. I had a letter of introduction to Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;,
one of the sisterhood, a lady of distinguished family in
England. I found her in the refectory. A dignified dejection
overspread her countenance, and her figure seemed
much emaciated by the scenes of horrour through which she
had passed. She informed me, that when the nuns were in
a state of arrestation by the order of Robespierre, the con<span class='pagenum'>141</span>vent
was so crowded with prisoners, that they were obliged
to eat their wretched meals in three different divisions. The
places of the unhappy beings who were led off to execution,
were immediately filled by fresh victims.</p>

<p>Amongst those who suffered, was the beautiful young
duchesse de Biron, said to be one of the loveliest women
of the french court. Her fate was singular, and horrible.
One morning, two of the assistant executioners came into
one of the rooms, and called upon the female citizen Biron
to come forward, meaning the old duchesse de Biron, the
mother, who was here immured with her daughter; some
one said, which of them do you require? The hell-hounds
replied, "Our order was for one only, but as there are two,
we will have both, that there may be no errour." The
mother and daughter were taken away, locked senseless in
each others arms. When the cart which carried them arrived
at the foot of the scaffold, the chief executioner
looked at his paper, which contained a list of his victims,
and saw the name of only one Biron; the assistants informed
him that they found two of that name in the convent,
and to prevent mistake, they had brought both. The
principal, with perfect sang froid, said it was all well,
wrote with a pencil the article "les" before the name
Biron, to which he added an s, and immediately beheaded
both!!!</p>

<p>Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; led me to the chapel, to show me the havoc
which the unspairing impious hands of the revolution had
there produced. She put into my hand an immense massy<span class='pagenum'>142</span>
key to open the door of the choir. "That key," said she,
"was made for the master-key of the convent, by the order
of Robespierre. In the time of terrour, our gaoler wore
it at his belt. A thousand times has my soul sunk
within me, when it loudly pushed the bolt of the lock
aside. When the door opened, it was either a signal
to prepare for instant death to some of those who were
within, or for the gloomy purpose of admitting new
victims." When we entered the chapel, my surprise and
abhorrence were equally excited. The windows were beaten
through, the hangings were flapping in the wind, the altar
was shattered in pieces and prostrate, the pavement was
every where torn up, and the caves of the dead were still
yawning upon us. From their solemn and hallowed depths,
the mouldering relics of the departed had been raised, by
torch light, and heaped in frightful piles of unfinished
decay against the walls, for the purpose of converting the
lead, which contained these wretched fragments of mortality,
into balls for the musketry of the revolution. The gardens
behind the chapel must have been once very pleasant, but they
then had the appearance of a wilderness. The painful uncertainty
of many years, had occasioned the neglect and
ruin in which I saw them. Some of the nuns were reading
upon shattered seats, under overgrown bowers, and
others were walking in the melancholy shade of neglected
avenues. The effect of the whole was gloomy and sorrowful,
and fully confirmed the melancholy recital which I received
from Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;. Bonaparte, it is said, intends to<span class='pagenum'>143</span>
confirm to these nuns their present residence, by an act of
government.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the convent I visited the seats of cassation,
and justice, in the architectural arrangement of which, I
saw but little worthy of minute notice, except the perfect
accommodation which pervades all the french buildings,
which are appropriated to the administration of the laws.</p>

<p>The hall of the first cassation, or grand court of appeal,
is very fine. The judges wear elegant costumes, and were,
as well as the advocates, seated upon chairs, which were
constructed to imitate the seats of roman magistracy, and
had a good effect. I was informed that the whole of the
ornamental arrangement was designed by David.</p>

<p>From the courts of justice, I went to the second national
library, which is very noble and large, and has a valuable
collection of books. Several students were arranged with
great silence and decorum, at long tables. In one apartment
is a very large, and ingenious model of Rome in a
glass case, and another of a frigate.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the library I proceeded to the Gobelins,
so called from one Gobel, a noted dyer at Rheims, who
settled here in the reign of Francis I. This beautiful manufactory
has a crowd of visitors every day. Upon the walls
of the galleries the tapestry is suspended, which exhibits
very exquisite copies of various historical paintings, of which
there are some very costly and beautiful specimens. The
artists work behind the frame, where the original from
which they copy is placed. The whole is a very expen<span class='pagenum'>144</span>sive
national establishment, much of its production is preserved
for presents to foreign princes, and some of it is disposed
of by public sale.</p>

<p>Upon the comparison between the works of the Gobelins
and the beautiful works of Miss Linwood, I could not
help feeling a little degree of pride to observe that my ingenious
countrywoman did not appear to suffer by it. Too
much praise cannot be bestowed upon the tasteful paintings
of her exquisite needle. This elegant minded woman has
manifested by her charming exhibition, that great genius is
not always separated from great labour, and unwearied perseverance.</p>

<p>From the Gobelins I visited the garden of plants, which is
considered to be the largest, and most valuable botanical collection
in Europe, and was founded by the celebrated Buffon.
The garden is laid out into noble walks, and beds containing
the rarest plants from all parts of the world, each of which
is neatly labelled for the use of the students. On the right
of the entrance is a park containing all sorts of deer, and
on the left are vast hothouses and greenhouses; in the centre,
enclosed in iron lattice work, is a large pond for the reception
of foreign aquatic animals, very near which is a
large octagon experimental beehive, about ten feet high, and
at the end, near the banks of the Seine, is a fine menagerie,
in which, amongst other beasts, there are some noble lions.
Many of the animals have separate houses, and gardens to
range in. Adjoining is the park of the elephant. This stupendous
animal, from the ample space in which he moves,<span class='pagenum'>145</span>
is seen to great advantage, and is considered to be the largest
of his species in Europe. Near the entrance, on the right,
is the museum of natural curiosities, the collection of which
is very valuable, and admirably arranged. There is here a
fine giraffe, or camelopard, of an amazing height, stuffed.
This surprising animal is a native of Ethiopia, and some
other parts of Africa, and has scarcely ever been seen in
Europe.</p>

<p>From the garden of plants, I made all possible dispatch
to Madame C&mdash;&mdash;'s, in the Boulevard Italien, where I was
engaged to dinner.</p>

<p>Upon crossing the Pont Neuf, where there are a number of
little stalls erected, the owners of which advertise upon little
boards, which are raised upon poles, that they possess extraordinary
talents for shearing dogs and cats; I could not
help stopping and laughing most heartily to observe the following
address to the public from one of these canine and grimalkin
functionaries:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Monin, tondit et coupe</span>
<span class="i0">les chiens la chatte</span>
<span class="i0">et sa femme&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">vat en ville."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Which runs in this ridiculous manner in english:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Monin shears and cuts</span>
<span class="i0">dogs and cats and his wife&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">goes on errands."</span>
<span class='pagenum'>146</span></div></div>

<p>As I had no time to return to my hotel to dress, I was
initiated into a mode of expeditiously equipping myself, by
a young friend who was with me, to which I was before a
stranger, and which shows in the most trifling matters, that
the french are good adepts in expedition and accommodation.
In passing through the Palais Royal, we entered the
little shop of a boot cleaner. In a moment I was mounted
upon a dirty sopha, to which I ascended by steps, and from
which I had a complete commanding view of the concourse
of gay people, who are always passing and repassing
in this idle place; the paper of the day, stretched upon a
little wooden frame was placed in my hand, each foot was
fixed upon an iron anvil, one man brushed off the dirt,
and another put on a shining blacking, a third brushed my
clothes, and a fourth presented a basin of water and towel
to me. The whole of this comfortable operation lasted about
four minutes. My dirty valets made me a low bow for
four sols, which, poor as the recompense was, exceeded
their expectations by three pieces of that petty coin.</p>

<p>In the evening, I had the happiness of being introduced
to Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;. Under his noble and hospitable roof,
amidst his affectionate, beautiful, and accomplished family,
and in the select circle of his elegant and enlightened society,
I passed many happy hours. Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; was of
a noble family, and previous to the revolution was one of
the fermiers generaux, and possessed a very noble fortune.
In discharging the duties of his distinguished and lucrative
office, he conciliated the affections of every one, who had<span class='pagenum'>147</span>
the good fortune to be comprehended within the compass
of his honourable authority, and when the revolution stripped
him of it, it found his integrity without a stain, except
what, in the bewildered interpretation of republican fury,
adhered to him from his connection with the old established
order of things. In the general, and undistinguishing cry
for blood, which yelled from the remorseless assassins of
Robespierre, this admirable man was consigned to a dungeon,
and doomed to the scaffold. Two hours before he
was to suffer, the remembrance of the noble victim, and of
a series of favours, of kindness, and of generosity, flashed,
with momentary but irresistible compunction, upon the mind
of one of his sanguinary judges, who, suspending the bloody
proceedings which then occupied the court, implored the
compassion of his fell associates. He pleaded until he had
obtained his discharge, and then at once forgetting the emotions
of mercy, which had inspired his tongue with the
most persuasive eloquence, he very composedly resumed the
functions of his cruel occupation, and consigned to the fatal
instrument of revolutionary slaughter, other beings, whose
virtues were less renowned, or less fortunate in their sphere
of operation. Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; had reached his sixty-eighth
year, but seemed to possess all the vivacity and health of
youth. His lady was a very amiable, and enlightened woman.
Their family consisted of a son, and three daughters,
all of them handsome, and very highly accomplished. The
eldest, Madame E&mdash;&mdash;, excelled in music; the second, Madame
B&mdash;&mdash;, in poetry and the classics; and the youngest,<span class='pagenum'>148</span>
Mademoiselle Delphine, in drawing and singing. I shall,
perhaps, be pardoned for introducing a little impromptu
compliment, which the pure, and unassuming merits of the
youngest of the family, drew from my pen, in consequence
of the conversation one evening, turning upon the indecorum
of the tunic dress, amongst the elegantes of Paris.</p>

<h5>TO MADEMOISELLE D.S.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whilst art array'd in <i>tunic</i> robe,</span>
<span class="i0">Tries over fashion's gaudy globe,</span>
<span class="i0">To hold resistless force,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy merits shall impede her course,</span>
<span class="i0">For grace and nature gain in thee,</span>
<span class="i0">A chaste, decisive victory.</span>
</div></div>

<p>From the general wreck of property Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; has
been fortunate enough to save a considerable portion of his
former fortune. A similar favourable circumstance has, in
general, rewarded the fortitude and constancy of those who,
in the political storm, refused to seek a dastard safety by
flight. Influenced by the reputation of the integrity, talents,
and experience of Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;, the first consul
has deservedly placed him at the head of the national accounts,
which he manages with great advantage, and honour
to the government. I was pressed to make this charming
house my home. Upon a noble terrace, which communicated
with the drawing room, and commanded a view of
all the gayety, and fashion of the Italien Boulevard, which<span class='pagenum'>149</span>
moved below us, in the circle of some of the most charming
people of Paris, we used to enjoy the refreshing coolness
of the evening, the graceful unpremeditated dance, or the
sounds of enchanting music. In this happy spot all parties
assembled. Those who had been divided by the ferocity of
politics, here met in amiable intercourse. I have in the
same room observed, the once pursuing republican conqueror,
in social converse with the captive vendeean general, who
had submitted to his prowess, and to the government. The
sword was not merely sheathed&mdash;it was <i>concealed</i> in flowers.
To please, and to be pleased; to charm, and to enlighten,
by interchanges of pleasantry, and politeness, and talents, and
acquirements, seemed alone to occupy the generous minds of
this charming society. The remembrance of the hours which
I passed under this roof, will afford my mind delight, as long
as the faculty of memory remains, or until high honour,
and munificent hospitality have lost their value, and genius
and beauty, purity and elegance have no longer any attractions.<span class='pagenum'>150</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Civility of a Sentinel.&mdash;The Hall of the Legislative Assembly.&mdash;British
House of Commons.&mdash;Captain Bergevet.&mdash;The Temple.&mdash;Sir Sydney
Smith's Escape.&mdash;Colonel Phillipeaux.</i></p></div>


<p>One morning, as I was entering the grand court of the hall
of the Legislative Assembly, I was stopped by a sentry. I told
him I was an Englishman. He politely begged my pardon,
and requested me to pass, and called one of the housekeepers
to show me the apartments.</p>

<p>This magnificent pile is in the Fauxbourg St. Germain, and
was formerly the palace of the Bourbons. After passing through
a suite of splendid apartments, I entered, through lofty folding
doors, into the hall, where the legislators assemble. It is a very
spacious semicircular room, and much resembles, in its arrangements
the appearance of a splendid theatre before the stage.
The ascent to the seat of the president is by a flight of light
marble steps; the facing of his bureau is composed of the
most costly marble, richly carved. On each side of the president's
chair are seats for the secretaries; and immediately
below them is the tribune, into which the orator ascends to
address the House. On each side of the seat of the president
are antique statues of eminent patriots and orators, which are
placed in niches in the wall. Under the tribune, upon the
centre of the floor, is the altar of the country, upon which, in
marble, is represented the book of the laws, resting upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
branches of olive. Behind it, upon semicircular seats, the
legislators sit, at the back of whom are the boxes of the embassadors,
and officers of state, and immediately above them,
within a colonnade of corinthian pillars, the public are admitted.
Round the upper part of the cornice, a beautiful
festoon of lilac coloured cloth, looped up with rich tassels, is
suspended, for the purpose of correcting the vibration of the
voice. The whole is very superb, and has cost the nation an
immense sum of money. The principal housekeeper asked me
"whether our speakers had such a place to declaim in," I told
him, "that we had very <i>great</i> orators in England, but that
they were content to speak in very little places." He laughed,
and observed, "that frenchmen never talked to so much advantage
as when their eye was pleased."</p>

<p>This man I found had been formerly one of the door keepers
of the national assembly, and was present when, after having
been impeached by Billaud, Panis, and their colleagues, Tallien
discharged <span class="errata" title="the">his</span> pistol at Robespierre, whom he helped to
support, until the monster was finally dispatched by the guillotine,
on the memorable 9th of Thermidor.</p>

<p>The french are amazingly fond of finery and stage effect.
The solicitude which always first manifested itself after any political
change in the course of the revolution, was the external decoration
of each new puppet who, arrayed in the brief authority
of the fleeting moment, was permitted to "play his fantastic
tricks before high Heaven."</p>

<p>The poor battered ark of government was left overturned,
under the protection of an escort of assassins, in the ensan<span class='pagenum'>152</span>guined
mud, upon the reeking bodies of its former, headless,
bearers, until its new supporters had adjusted the rival pretensions
of silk and satin, and had consulted the pattern book
of the laceman in the choice of their embroidery. On one
side of the arch which leads into the antiroom of the legislative
assembly, are suspended patterns and designs for tickets of
admission to the sitting, elegantly framed, and near the same
place, in a long gallery which leads to the dressing-rooms of
the legislators, are boxes which contain the senatorial robes of
the members. The meetings of our house of commons would
inspire more awe, and veneration, if more attention was paid
to decorum, and external decoration. A dignified and manly
magnificence would not be unsuitable to the proceedings of
the sanctuary of british laws, and the seat of unrivalled eloquence.
What would a perfumed french legislator say, accustomed
to rise in the rustling of embroidered silks, and
gracefully holding in his hand, a cap of soft and showy plumes,
to address himself to alabaster statues, glittering lustres, grecian
chairs, festoons of drapery, and an audience of beings
tricked out as fine as himself, were he to be suddenly transported
into a poor and paltry room, meanly lighted, badly
ventilated, and inconveniently arranged, and to be told that,
in that spot, the representatives of the first nation in the world,
legislated for her subjects? What would he say, were he to
see and hear in the mean attire of jockeys and mechanics,
such orators as Greece and Rome never saw or heard in the
days of their most exalted glory; unfolding with the penetration
of a subordinate Providence, the machinations of a dark<span class='pagenum'>153</span>
and deep conspiracy, erecting elaborate laws to shelter the
good, against the enemies of repose, or hurling the thunder
of their eloquence against the common foes of their country.
The astonished frenchman would very likely say, "I always
thought that the english were a strange set of beings, but
they now exceed the powers of my comprehension, they
can elicit wit in the midst of gloom, and can say such
things in a plain unbrushed coat of <i>blue</i> cloth, as all the
robes, plumes, and finery of the republic, in her gaudy
halls of deliberation, cannot inspire."</p>

<p>From the legislative assembly I went to pay my respects to
the gallant captain Bergeret, to whom I had letters of introduction.
It will be immediately remembered, that this distinguished
hero, in the Virginie, displayed the most undaunted
courage, when she was engaged by sir Edward Pellew, in the
Indefatigable, to whose superior prowess and naval knowledge,
he was obliged to strike the tricolour flag. His bravery and integrity
have justly entitled him to the admiration and lasting friendship
of his noble conqueror, and to the esteem of the british nation.
When sir Sidney Smith was confined in the Temple, and
captain Bergeret a prisoner in England, the latter was sent to
France upon his parole, to endeavour to effect the exchange
of sir Sidney. The french government, which was then
under the direction of some of the basest and meanest of her
tyrants, refused to listen to the proposal; and at the same time
resisted the return of their own countryman.</p>

<p>The gallant Bergeret was resolved to preserve his word of
honour unsullied, or to perish in the attempt. Finding all his<span class='pagenum'>154</span>
efforts to obtain the liberation of the illustrious captive unavailing,
menaced with death if he departed, and invited by
promised command and promotion if he remained, he contrived
to quit his own country by stealth, and returned a voluntary
exile to his generous and confiding conquerors.</p>

<p>From captain B&mdash;&mdash;'s hotel I went to the Temple, so celebrated
in the gloomy history of the revolution. It stands in
the Rue du Temple, in the Fauxbourg of that name. The
entrance is handsome, and does not much impress the idea of the
approach to a place of such confinement. Over the gates is
a pole, supporting a dirty and tattered bonnet rouge, of which
species of republican decoration there are very few now to be
seen in Paris. The door was opened to me by the principal
gaoler, whose predecessor had been dismissed on account of
his imputed connivance in the escape of sir Sidney Smith.
His appearance seemed fully to qualify him for his savage office,
and to insure his superiors against all future apprehension, of
a remission of duty by any act of humanity, feeling, or commiseration.
He told me, that he could not permit me to advance
beyond the lodge, on account of a peremptory order
which he had just received from government. From this place
I had a full command of the walk and prison, the latter of
which is situated in the centre of the walls. He pointed out
to me the window of the room in which the royal sufferers
languished. As the story of sir Sidney Smith's escape from
this prison has been involved in some ambiguity, a short recital
of it will, perhaps, not prove uninteresting.</p>

<p>After several months had rolled away, since the gates of his<span class='pagenum'>155</span>
prison had first closed upon the british hero, he observed that
a lady who lived in an upper apartment on the opposite side
of the street, seemed frequently to look towards that part of
the prison in which he was confined. As often as he observed
her, he played some tender air upon his flute, by which, and
by imitating every motion which she made, he at length succeeded
in fixing her attention upon him, and had the happiness
of remarking that she occasionally observed him with a
glass. One morning when he saw that she was looking attentively
upon him in this manner, he tore a blank leaf from an
old mass book which was lying in his cell, and with the soot
of the chimney, contrived, by his finger, to describe upon it,
in a large character, the letter A, which he held to the window
to be viewed by his fair sympathizing observer. After gazing
upon it for some little time, she nodded, to show that she
understood what he meant, sir Sidney then touched the top
of the first bar of the grating of his window, which he wished
her to consider as the representative of the letter A, the second
B, and so on, until he had formed, from the top of the bars,
a corresponding number of letters; and by touching the middle,
and bottom parts of them, upon a line with each other, he
easily, after having inculcated the first impression of his wishes,
completed a telegraphic alphabet. The process of communication
was, from its nature, very slow, but sir Sidney had the
happiness of observing, upon forming the first word, that this
excellent being, who beamed before him like a guardian
angel, seemed completely to comprehend it, which she expressed
by an assenting movement of the head. Frequently<span class='pagenum'>156</span>
obliged to desist from this tacit and tedious intercourse, from
the dread of exciting the curiosity of the gaolers, or his fellow
prisoners, who were permitted to walk before his window,
sir Sidney occupied several days in communicating to his unknown
friend, his name and quality, and imploring her to
procure some unsuspected royalist of consequence and address
sufficient for the undertaking, to effect his escape; in the
achievement of which he assured her, upon his word of honour,
that whatever cost might be incurred, would be amply
reimbursed, and that the bounty and gratitude of his country
would nobly remunerate those who had the talent, and bravery
to accomplish it. By the same means he enabled her to draw
confidential and accredited bills, for considerable sums of money,
for the promotion of the scheme, which she applied with
the most perfect integrity. Colonel Phelipeaux was at this
time at Paris; a military man of rank, and a secret royalist,
most devoutly attached to the fortunes of the exiled family of
France, and to those who supported their cause. He had been
long endeavouring to bring to maturity, a plan for facilitating
their restoration, but which the loyal adherent, from a series
of untoward and uncontrollable circumstances, began to despair
of accomplishing. The lovely deliverer of sir Sidney,
applied to this distinguished character, to whom she was known,
and stated the singular correspondence which had taken place
between herself and the heroic captive in the Temple. Phelipeaux,
who was acquainted with the fame of sir Sidney,
and chagrined at the failure of his former favourite scheme,
embraced the present project with a sort of prophetic enthu<span class='pagenum'>157</span>siasm,
by which he hoped to restore, to the british nation,
one of her greatest heroes, who, by his skill and valour, might
once more impress the common enemy with dismay, augment
the glory of his country, and cover himself with the laurels
of future victory. Intelligent, active, cool, daring, and insinuating,
colonel Phelipeaux immediately applied himself to
bring to maturity, a plan at once suitable to his genius, and
interesting to his wishes. To those whom it was necessary
to employ upon the occasion, he contrived to unite one of
the clerks of the minister of the police, who forged his signature
with exact imitation, to an order for removing the body
of sir Sidney, from the Temple to the prison of the Conciergerie:
after this was accomplished, on the day after that on
which the inspector of gaols was to visit the Temple and Conciergerie,
a ceremony, which is performed once a month in
Paris, two gentlemen of tried courage and address, who were
previously instructed by colonel Phelipeaux, disguised as officers
of the marechaussee, presented themselves in a fiacre at
the Temple, and demanded the delivery of sir Sidney, at the
same time showing the forged order for his removal. This
the gaoler attentively perused and examined, as well as the
minister's signature. Soon after the register of the prison informed
sir Sidney of the order of the directory, upon hearing
which, he at first appeared to be a little disconcerted, upon
which the pseudoofficers gave him every assurance of the
honour and mild intentions of the government towards him,
sir Sidney seemed more reconciled, packed up his clothes,
took leave of his fellow prisoners, and distributed little tokens<span class='pagenum'>158</span>
of his gratitude to those servants of the prison, from whom he
had experienced indulgencies. Upon the eve of their departure,
the register observed, that four of the prison guard
should accompany them. This arrangement menaced the
whole plan with immediate dissolution. The officers, without
betraying the least emotion, acquiesced in the propriety of the
measure, and gave orders for the men to be called out, when,
as if recollecting the rank and honour of their illustrious prisoner,
one of them addressed sir Sidney, by saying, "citizen,
you are a brave officer, give us your parole, and there is no
occasion for an escort." Sir Sidney replied, that he would
pledge his faith, as an officer, to accompany them, without
resistance, wherever they chose to conduct him.</p>

<p>Not a look or movement betrayed the intention of the party.
Every thing was cool, well-timed, and natural. They entered
a fiacre, which, as is usual, was brought for the purpose of
removing him, in which he found changes of clothes, false
passports, and money. The coach moved with an accustomed
pace, to the Faubourg St. Germain, where they alighted,
and parted in different directions. Sir Sidney met colonel
Phelipeaux at the appointed spot of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The project was so ably planned and conducted, that no
one but the party concerned was acquainted with the escape,
until near a month had elapsed, when the inspector paid his
next periodical visit. What pen can describe the sensations of
two such men as sir Sidney and Phelipeaux, when they first
beheld each other in safety? Heaven befriended the generous
and gallant exploit. Sir Sidney and his noble friend, reached<span class='pagenum'>159</span>
the french coast wholly unsuspected, and committing themselves
to their God, and to the protective genius of brave men,
put to sea in an open boat, and were soon afterwards discovered
by an english cruising frigate, and brought in safety to the
british shores.</p>

<p>The gallant Phelipeaux soon afterwards accompanied sir
Sidney in the Tigre to Acre, where, overwhelmed by the
fatigue of that extraordinary campaign, in which he supported
a distinguished part, and the noxious influence of a sultry
climate, operating upon a delicate frame, he expired in the
arms of his illustrious friend, who attended him to his grave,
and shed the tears of gratitude and friendship over his honoured
and lamented obsequies. But ere the dying Phelipeaux
closed his eyes, he received the rewards of his generous
enterprise. He beheld the repulsed legions of the republic,
flying before the british banners, and the irresistible prowess
of his valiant companion; he beheld the distinguished being,
whom he had thus rescued from a dungeon, and impending
destruction, by an act of almost romantic heroism, covered
with the unparticipated glory, of having overpowered a leader,
who, renowned, and long accustomed to conquest, saw, for
the first time, his <i>invincible troops</i> give way; who, inflamed to
desperation, deemed the perilous exposure of his person necessary,
to rally them to the contest, over bridges of their slaughtered
comrades, but who at length was obliged to retire from
the field of battle, and to leave to the heroic sir Sidney, the
exclusive exultation of announcing to his grateful and elated<span class='pagenum'>160</span>
country, that he had fought, and vanquished the laurelled
conqueror of Italy, and the bold invader of Egypt.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney has no vices to conceal behind his spreading
and imperishable laurels. His public character is before the
approving world. That peace which his sword has accelerated,
has afforded us an undisturbed opportunity of admiring his
achievements in the field, and of contemplating his conduct in
the retired avenues of private life, in which his deportment is
without a stain. In him there is every thing to applaud, and
nothing to forgive.</p>

<p>Yet thus glorious in public, and thus unsullied in private,
the conqueror of Bonaparte, and the saviour of the
east, owes the honours, <i>which he adorns</i>, to foreign and distant
powers.</p>

<p>To the <i>grateful</i> government of his own country, he is indebted
for an ungracious paltry annuity, inadequate to the
display of ordinary consequence, and wholly unequal to the
suitable support of that dignity, which ought for ever to distinguish
such a being from the mass of mankind.</p>

<p>The enemies of sir Sidney, for envy furnishes every great
man with his quota of such indirect eulogists, if they should
honour these pages with a perusal, may, perchance, endeavour
to trace the approving warmth with which I have
spoken of him, to the enthusiasm of a friendship dazzled,
and undiscriminating; but I beg to assure them, that the
fame of sir Sidney is better known to me than his person,
and that his noble qualities have alone excited the humble<span class='pagenum'>161</span>
tribute which is here offered to one, for whom delighted
Nature, in the language of our immortal bard,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The conversation whilst I was at Paris, was much engaged
by a poem, describing the genius and progress of christianity
written in imitation of the style of Ossian, which excited very
considerable curiosity. From the remarks of some shrewd acquaintances
of mine, who had perused the work, I learnt that
the principles of the poem seemed strongly tinctured with the
bewildered fancies of a disordered mind, conveyed in very
heavy <i>prosaic</i> blank verse. "It was the madness of poetry,
without the inspiration."</p>

<p>This composition may be considered as a curiosity, from
other reasons than those which mere criticism affords. The
poem was bad, the readers were many. The subject was sacred,
the author a reputed atheist, and the profits which it
produced exceeded two thousand pounds sterling. The fortunate
writer relieved himself from the jaws of famine by
this strange incomprehensible eulogy on the charms and advancement
of christianity, which has been received in Paris,
with a sort of fashionable frenzy. Another pseudobard has
announced his intention very shortly of issuing from the press,<span class='pagenum'>163</span>
a work which he conceives will be more saleable and a greater
favourite with the public, in which he intends ironically to
combat the doctrine of the Trinity, by gravely resembling
it to the Deity taking snuff between two looking glasses, so
that when he sneezes, two resemblances of him are seen to
sneeze also, and yet that there are not three sneezers, but one
sneezer.</p>

<p>Some other outlines of this work were imparted to me at
Paris, but the pen turns with disgust and detestation, from such
low and nauseous profanation. I have only condescended to
mention the composition, and the last anecdote, to show how
much the world is deluded, by the received opinion that the
french are become a new race of exemplary devotees. The
recoil from atheism to enthusiasm, is not unusual, but the french
in general have not, as yet, experienced this change. That
they are susceptible of extraordinary transitions, their history
and revolution have sufficiently manifested. In the Journal
de Paris, written in the reigns of Charles VI and VII, is
preserved rather a curious account of the velocity with which
religious zeal has, in former periods, been excited. "On the
4th day of April, 1429," says the journal, "the duke of
Burgundy came to Paris, with a very fine body of knights
and esquires; and eight days afterwards there came to Paris,
a cordelier, by name Frere Richart, a man of great prudence,
very knowing in prayer, a giver of good doctrine to edify
his neighbour, and was so successful, that he who had not
seen him, was bursting with envy against those who had.
He was but one day in Paris, without preaching. He began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
his sermon about five o'clock in the morning, and continued
preaching till ten or eleven o'clock, and there
were always between five and six thousand persons to hear
him preach. This cordelier preached on St. Mark's Day,
attended by the like number of persons, and on their
return from his sermon, the people of Paris were so turned,
and moved to devotion, that in three or four hours time,
there were more than one hundred fires lighted, in which
they burnt their chess boards, their back gammon tables, and
their packs of cards."</p>

<p>To this sort of fanaticism, the parisians are unquestionably
not arrived. A more eloquent man than the Frere Richart,
must appear amongst them, before such meliorations as are
recorded in the Paris journal, can be effected in the dissolute
and uncontrolled habits of that gay and voluptuous city. I
do not mean, from any previous remark which I have made,
to infer that there are not many good and very pious people
in France, and it has been a favourable circumstance to the
ancient religion of <span class="errata" title="France">the country</span>, that the revolution never attempted
any reform in it, or to substitute another mode of worship.
That great political change in the ebullition of its fury, prostrated
the altars of the old church, without raising others of a new,
or improved construction. It presented a hideous rebellion
against the glorious author of all good, and declared an
indiscriminate war of extermination against his ministers and
followers, and every principle of the Gospel and morality.
Every form of faith, every mode of adoration, fell indiscriminately
under the proscriptions of its unsparing wrath.<span class='pagenum'>165</span>
The towering abbey and humble oratory, were alike swept
away in the general tornado, and mingled their ruins together.
But the race of the good were not all expelled from
this scene of havoc and outrage. The voice of piety still
found a passage to her God. The silent prayer pierced through
the compact covering of the dungeon, and ascended to
Heaven. Within the embowering unsearchable recesses of
the soul, far beyond the reach of revolutionary persecution,
the pure unappalled spirit of devotion erected her viewless
temple, in secret magnificence, sublime, and unassailable!</p>

<p>The child who had never heard the bell of the sabbath
sound, who had never beheld the solemn ceremonies of authorized
adoration, was told that those awful and splendid piles,
which filled his eyes with wonder, and his mind with instinctive
reverence, were raised for other purposes than those of
becoming auxiliary to the ferocity of war. That genius and
taste, and toil and cost, had not thus expended their unrivalled
powers, and lavished their munificent resources, in
erecting <i>gothic</i> magazines of gunpowder, and <i>saxon</i> sheds for
the accommodation of atheistic fabricators of revolutionary
cannon balls.</p>

<p>The young observer in private, and by stealth imbibed,
from parental precept or example, the sentiment of a national
religion, suppressed, not extinguished, or in the gloomy absence
of all indications of it, remained unsolicited by any
rival mode of worship to bestow his apostacy upon an alien
creed. Thus the minds of the rising generation, who were
engaged in favour of the catholic persuasion, during the<span class='pagenum'>166</span>
frightful period of its long denunciation, by stolen, secluded
and unfinished displays of its spirit and form, contemplated its
return with animated elation, or beheld its approach, unimpressed
with those doubts or prejudices which religious, as well as
secular competitions, very frequently excite; in that auspicious
hour, when the policy, if not the piety of a powerful government,
restored it to the French people. The subject is highly
interesting; but I must resign it to abler pens for more ample
discussion.</p>

<p>I was much gratified by being presented to the celebrated
philosopher Mons. Charles, by Madame S&mdash;&mdash;. He has a suite
of noble apartments in the Louvre, which have been bestowed
upon him by the government, as a grateful reward for his
having presented to the nation his magnificent collection of
philosophical apparatus. He has also, in consideration of his
ability and experience, been constituted the principal lecturer
on philosophy. In these rooms his valuable and costly donation
is arranged. In the centre of the dome of the first apartment,
called the Hall of Electricity, is suspended the car of the first
balloon which was inflated with inflammable air, in which he
and his brother ascended in the afternoon of the 1st of December,
1783, in which they continued in the air for an hour and
three quarters; and after they had descended, Mons. C&mdash;&mdash;
rose alone to the astonishing height of 10,500 feet. In the same
room are immense electrical machines and batteries, some of
which had been presented to him by Madame S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>In this room, amongst many other fanciful figures, which are
used for the purpose of enlivening the solemnity of a philo<span class='pagenum'>167</span>sophical
lecture by exciting sentiments of innocent gayety, was
a little Cupid. The tiny god, with his arrow in his hand,
was insulated upon a throne of glass, and was charged with that
electric fluid which not a little resembles the subtle spirit of
his nature. The youngest daughter of Madame S&mdash;&mdash;, who
accompanied us, was requested to touch it. In a moment it
discharged its penetrating spark&mdash;"Oh! how that little god
has alarmed me!" said the recoiling fair one, whose youthful
countenance surprise had imbued with new beauties; "but
yet," said she, recovering herself, "<i>he does not hurt</i>." This
little sally may be considered as a specimen of that playful
sprightliness which is so much the characteristic of the french
female.</p>

<p>In the centre of another room, dedicated to optics, as we
entered, we saw a beautiful nosegay in a vase, which appeared
to be composed of the rarest flowers. I approached it with
an intention of inhaling its fragrance, when, lo! my hand
passed through it. It was an exquisite optical illusion. "Ah!"
said my elegant and moralising companion, Madame S&mdash;&mdash;,
smiling, "of such flowers has Happiness composed <i>her</i> wreath:
it is thus she gladdens with it the eye of Hope; but the hand
of Expectation can never grasp it."</p>

<p>The graceful moral deserves a more lasting record than it
will find in these few and perishable pages.</p>

<p>In the other rooms are all sorts of apparatus for trying experiments
in the various branches of that department of science,
over which Mons. C&mdash;&mdash; so ably presides.</p>

<p>The merit of Mons. C&mdash;&mdash; has no rival but in his mo<span class='pagenum'>168</span>desty.
Considering the rank and estimation which he bears
in the republic, his external appearance is singularly unassuming.
I have been with him in the gardens of the
Thuilleries, when they were thronged with the fashion and
gayety of Paris, where he has appeared in a suit of plain brown
cloth, an old round hat with a little national cockade in
it, under which he presented a countenance full of character,
talent and animation. In this homely puritan garb, he excited
more respectful curiosity, wherever he moved, than some
generals who paraded before us in dresses upon which the
tailor and embroiderer had long laboured, and who added to
their stature by laced hats entirely filled with gaudy buoyant
plumes.</p>

<p>From Mons. Charles we went to the church of St.
Rocque, in the Rue St. Honor&egrave;. As we entered, the effect
of a fine painting of our Saviour crucified, upon which the
sun was shining with great glory, placed at the extremity of
the church, and seen through several lessening arches of
faint, increasing shade, was very grand. This church has been
more than once the scene of revolutionary carnage. Its
elegant front is much disfigured, and the doors are perforated,
in a great number of places, by the ball of cannon and the
shot of musketry. Mass was performing in the church; but
we saw only few worshippers, and those were chiefly old
women and little girls.</p>

<p>From St. Rocque we proceeded to the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides,
the chapel and dome of which are so justly celebrated.
The front is inferior to the military hospital at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Chelsea, to which it bears some resemblance. The chapel is
converted into the Hall of Victory, in which, with great taste,
are suspended, under descriptive medallions, the banners of
the enemies of the republic, which have been taken during
the late war, the numbers of which are immense. The
same decoration adorns the pilasters and gallery <span class="errata" title="at">of</span> the vast,
magnificent dome at the end of the hall.</p>

<p>My eye was naturally occupied, immediately after we had
entered, in searching amongst the most <i>battered</i> of the banners,
for the british colours: at last I discovered the jack and ensign
of an english man of war, pierced with shot-holes, and
blackened with smoke, looking very sulky, and indignantly,
amongst the finery, and tawdry tatters of italian and turkish
standards.</p>

<p>In the course of this pursuit, I caught the intelligent eye of
Madame S&mdash;&mdash;. She immediately assigned to my search the
proper motive. "Ah!" said she, laughingly, and patting me
on the arm with her fan, "we are, as you see, my dear
Englishman, very vain; and you are very proud."</p>

<p>A stranger to the late calamitous war, unable to marshal in
his mind the enemies of the republic, might here, with a glance
of his eye, whilst contemplating this poor result of devastation,
enumerate the foes of France, and appreciate the facilities or
difficulties of the victory.</p>

<p>In observing, amidst this gaudy show of captive colours, only
two hardworn banners of their rival enemy, he would draw
a conclusion too flattering and familiar to an English ear, to
render it necessary to be recorded here.<span class='pagenum'>170</span></p>

<p>Upon the shattered standards of Austria he would confer
the meed of merited applause for heroic, although unprevailing
bravery.</p>

<p>To the banners of Prussia he would say, "I know not whether
principle or policy, or treachery, or corruption, deterred you
from the field&mdash;Your looks exhibit no proofs of sincere
resistance&mdash;However, you never belonged to cowards."</p>

<p>The neapolitan ensign might excite such sentiments as these:
"You appear for a short time to have faced the battle&mdash;You
were unfortunate, and soon retired."</p>

<p>To the gaudy drapeaus of the italian and turkish legions,
which every where present the appearance of belonging to the
wardrobe of a pantomimic hero, he would observe, "The
scent of the battle has not perfumed you; its smoke has not
sullied your shining, silky sides. Ye appear in numbers,
but display no marks of having waved before a brave, united
and energetic band."</p>

<p>In this manner might he trace the various fate of the war.
Upon several of the staffs only two or three shreds of colours
are to be seen adhering. These are chiefly Austrian. On
each side of the chapel are large, and some of them valuable
paintings, by the french masters, representing the conquests of
the french armies at different eras.</p>

<p>It is a matter not unworthy of observation, that although the
revolution with a keen, and savage eye, explored too successfully,
almost every vestige of a royal tendency, the beautiful
pavement under the dome of the invalides has escaped destruction.
The fleur de lis, surmounted by the crown of France,<span class='pagenum'>171</span>
still retains its original place, in this elegant and costly marble
flooring. The statues of the saints have been removed; and
their places are supplied by the new order of revolutionary
deities; but the names of the ancient figures have not been
erased from the pedestals of the new ones: to which omission
the spectator is indebted for a smile when contemplating the
statue of Equality, he reads, immediately below his feet,
"<i>St. Louis</i>."</p>

<p>There is here a costly monument erected to the memory
of the brave marshal Turenne, who was killed by a cannon
ball in 1675. In my humble opinion, it is too much in the
false taste of french statuary. A groupe of weeping angels
surround the recumbent hero, in the attitudes of operatic
figurantes, in whose faces, and forms, the artist has attempted,
too laboriously and artificially, to delineate the expressions of
graceful grief. On each side of the vast arch which divides
the dome from the chapel, are raised the tablets of military
honour, on which, in characters of gold, the names of those
soldiers are recorded who have distinguished themselves for
their achievements in the late war. As we were contemplating
a painting upon a very large scale, in which, amongst other
figures, is an uncovered whole length of a warrior, a prudish-looking
lady, who seemed to have touched the age of desperation,
after having very attentively beheld it with her glass for
some time, observed to her party, that there was a great deal of
indecorum in the picture. Madame S&mdash;&mdash; very shrewdly
whispered in my ear, that the indecorum was in the
remark.<span class='pagenum'>172</span></p>

<p>When we were just leaving the chapel, we overheard a sun-browned
soldier, who had lost both his legs, observe to his companion,
to whom he was explaining the colours, pointing to
the banners of the turkish cavalry, the tops of whose staffs
were surmounted with horses' tails, "Look at those ribbands;
they are not worthy of being worn when won." This military
hospital is capable of accommodating 3,000 soldiers. The
bedrooms, kitchens, refectory and outoffices are very capacious,
and, what is rather unusual in France, clean and comfortable.
The day before we were there, the first consul paid a visit to
its veteran inhabitants. Amongst them, he recognised an old,
and very brave soldier, whose exploits were the frequent
theme of his aged comrades. The young general told him
that he should die a captain, took him in his carriage to dine
with him at Mal Maison, presented him with a medallion of
honour, and conferred upon him the rank of a captain, in
one of the most distinguished regiments.</p>

<p>From this place we went to the military school adjoining, in
which Bonaparte received the rudiments of that education which
was destined to form the foundation of his future glory. The
building is large and handsome, and is, from a very natural
sentiment, in high favour with the first consul. There is nothing
in it particular to describe. The grounds and gardens
are very spacious and fine. In the front of the military school
is the celebrated Champ de Mars, which is an immense flat
space of ground. On each side are rising terraces of earth,
and double rows of trees; and at the further end, the river
Seine flows. On days of great national celebrations, this vast<span class='pagenum'>173</span>
plain is surrounded with Gobelins tapestry, statues, and
triumphal arches. After contemplating these objects of public
curiosity, we returned to Mons. S&mdash;&mdash; to dinner, where we
met a large party of very pleasant people. Amongst them I
was pleased with meeting a near relative of an able and upright
minister of the republic, to whose unwearied labours the world
is not a little indebted for the enjoyments of its present
repose.</p>

<p>After dinner we drove to the beautiful garden of Mousseau,
formerly the property of the duc d'Orleans. It is laid out with
great taste, and delights the eye with the most romantic specimens
of improved rural beauty. It was originally designed
by its detestable owner for other purposes than those of affording
to a vast and crowded city the innocent delights and recreations
of retired and tasteful scenery. In the gloom of its groves,
all sorts of horrible profanations were practised by this monster
and his midnight crew, at the head of whom was Legendre
the Butcher. Every rank recess of prostitute pollution in
Paris was ransacked to furnish materials for the celebration of
their impure and impious orgies. The ode to Atheism, and the
song of Blasphemy, were succeeded by the applauding yells
of Drunkenness and Obscenity.</p>

<p>At the time we visited this garden it belonged to the nation,
and was open, on certain days, to well-dressed people. A few
days afterwards, it was presented, as a mark of national esteem,
to Cambaceres, the second consul.</p>

<p>Here we rambled till the evening. The sun was setting.
The nightingales were singing in great numbers. Not a cloud<span class='pagenum'>174</span>
to be seen. A breeze, blowing through a plantation of roses,
refreshed us with its coolness and fragrance. In a sequestered
part of this beautiful ground, under the embowering shades of
Acacia trees, upon the ruins of a little temple, we seated ourselves,
and were regaled by some charming italian duets, which
were sung by Madame S&mdash;&mdash; and her lovely daughter, with
the most enchanting pathos. I hope I shall be pardoned for
introducing some lines which were written upon our return,
by an enthusiastic admirer of merit and music.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Curious Method of raising Hay.&mdash;Lucien Bonaparte's H&ocirc;tel.&mdash;Opera.&mdash;Consular
Box.&mdash;Madame Bonaparte's Box.&mdash;Feydeau
Theatre.&mdash;Belle Vue.&mdash;Versailles.&mdash;The Palace of the Petit
Trianon.&mdash;The Grounds.</i></p></div>


<p>The people of Paris, who keep horses in stables at the
back of their houses, have a singular mode of keeping their
hay in the lofts of their dwelling houses. At the top of a
spacious and elegant hotel, is to be seen a projecting crane in
the act of raising loads of winter provision for the stable.
When I first saw this strange process, my surprise would
scarcely have been increased, had I beheld the horse ascending
after the hay.</p>

<p>I must not forget to offer some little description of the opera,
where, during my stay, through the politeness of Madame
H&mdash;&mdash;, I had free access to a private box.</p>

<p>This spacious and splendid theatre is lighted from above by
an immense circular lustre of patent lamps. The form of this
brilliant light is in the antique taste, and it is said to have cost
two thousand pounds sterling. The effect which it produces
in the body of the theatre, and upon the scenery, is admirable.
It prevents the sight from being divided, and distracted by
girandoles. This establishment is upon so vast a scale, that
government, which is the proprietor, is always a loser upon
balancing the receipts and disbursements of each night. The<span class='pagenum'>176</span>
stage and its machinery have for many years occupied a
great number of the subordinate classes of people, who, if not
employed in this manner, would in all probability become
burdensome, and unpleasant to the government. To this
circumstance is attributable the superiority of the machinery,
and scenery, over every other theatre which I ever saw. In
the english theatres, my eye has often been offended at the
representations of the internal parts of houses, in which not
a chair, or table is introduced, for the purpose of carrying
on the ingenious deception. Upon the stage of the french
opera, every scene has its appropriate furniture, and distinctive
appendages, which are always produced as soon as
the scene drops, by numerous attendants. From this attention
to the minute circumstances of the drama, the illusion
becomes enchanting. The orchestra is very fine, and is composed
of ninety eminent musicians. The corps de ballet
consists of between eighty and ninety fine dancers, of whom
Monsieur Deshayes is the principal. His movements are
more graceful, his agility more surprising, and his step
more light, firm, and elastic, than those of any dancer
whom I have ever seen. He is very justly considered to be
the first in Europe. The first consul has a private box
here, on one side of which, a lofty, hollow, decorative column
rises, the flutes of which are open, and through
which he views, [printing unclear: unseen,] the audience and performers. The
beholder might be almost inclined to think that this surprising
man had borrowed from our immortal bard, his no<span class='pagenum'>177</span>tions
of exciting the impression of dignity, by a rare, and
well timed display of his person.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus did I keep my person fresh, and new;</span>
<span class="i0">My presence like a robe pontifical,</span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er seen but wondered at: and so my state</span>
<span class="i0">Seldom, but sumptuous shewed, like a feast</span>
<span class="i0">And won by rareness such solemnity."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Madame Bonaparte's box is on the left side of the stage,
over the door, in which the hapless queen has frequently
displayed her beautiful person to the enraptured audience.</p>

<p>The Feydeau theatre is very elegant; and on account of
its excellent arrangements, good performers, and exquisite
machinery, is much resorted to, and is in general preferred
to the fourteen other dramatic spectacles which, in this dissipated
city, almost every night present their tribute of pleasure
to the gay, and delighted parisians. A frenchman
once observed to me, that a Sunday in London was horrible,
on account of there being no playhouses open at
night! The decorum and good manners which are even
still observed in all the french places of public amusement,
are very impressive, and agreeable. Horse and foot soldiers
are stationed at the avenues, to keep them clear, to
prevent depredation, and to quell the first indications of popular
commotion.</p>

<p>I was much gratified by an excursion to Versailles, which
had been some time planned by the charming family of the<span class='pagenum'>178</span>
S&mdash;&mdash;'s. We set off early in the morning, in one of the
government carriages, and after a delightful ride, through a
very rich, and luxuriant country, of about twelve miles, the
vast, and magnificent palace of Versailles, opened upon our
view, at the end of a street nearly two miles long, lined on
each side with noble hotels, and gardens. It was on a Sunday,
the day on which the palace is opened to the public.
On the road, we passed several hundreds of persons in carriages,
cabrioles, or walking; all with merry faces, in showy
clothes, and adorned with bouquets, on their route to this
spot of favourite delight.</p>

<p>About four miles from Paris we saw Belle Vue, formerly
the residence of Mesdames; soon afterwards we passed the
noble palace, and park of St. Cloud, which was preparing
for the reception of the first consul.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the village of St. Cloud, on the left,
after we had passed the bridge, we saw a very pretty house,
and grounds, belonging to a tanner, who had amassed considerable
wealth by a discovery of tanning leather in twenty-four
hours, so as to render it fit for the currier. Whether
he possesses this faculty or not, I cannot from my
own experience say, but I can venture to affirm, that the
leather of France is very bad. In the village is a very
noble porcelain manufactory, which unfortunately we had
not time to inspect.</p>

<p>Whilst our horses were refreshing themselves with a little
water, we were beset by the agents of the different hotels,
and restaurateurs of Versailles, who presented us with little<span class='pagenum'>179</span>
cards, announcing in a very pompous manner the superiority
of their employers accommodations.</p>

<p>The stables of Versailles, to the right, and left, are from
the designs of Mansart, in the form of a crescent, and have
the appearance of princely residences. Here the late King
kept in the greatest style six hundred of the finest horses.
On the left of the grand gateway, is a military lodge for the
accommodation of cavalry. It represents in shape, an immense
turkish marquee. After we had passed the pallisades
of the first court, we more distinctly saw this amazing pile
of irregular buildings, which consists of the old castle, the
new palaces, the houses of the ministers of state, and servants,
two opera houses, the chapel, military schools, museums,
and the manufactory of arms, the whole of which
are now consolidated, and form one palace.</p>

<p>The beautiful pavement of black and white marble in the
court yards, is much defaced, and their fountains are totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>The first place we visited was the manufactory of small
arms; the resident workmen in which exceed two thousand
men. Here we saw all the ingenious process of constructing
the musket, pistol, and sabre, of which there are an
immense collection; and also several carbines, and swords of
honour, intended as presents from the first consul to officers
and soldiers of distinguished merit.</p>

<p>From the manufactory of small arms, we returned to the
grand court, and entered a suite of rooms, which contain
the relics of the former valuable cabinet of curiosities. Se<span class='pagenum'>180</span>veral
of those which we saw, were worthy of attention.
From these rooms, we passed to the late king's private opera
house, which surpasses in magnificence, and costly decoration,
every thing of the kind I ever beheld. The facing
of the whole of the inside is of carved wood, richly gilt.
The dome is beautifully painted. Upon the scenery of the
stage being removed, and temporary columns, and galleries
raised; all of which can be effected in twenty-four hours,
that part of the theatre presents a counterpart of the other,
and the whole forms a most splendid oblong ball room,
very deservedly considered to be the finest in Europe: it
used to be illuminated by ten thousand wax lights. The
concert rooms, and retiring apartments are also very beautiful.
From the opera, we visited the chapel, which is very fine,
and costly, in which there are many large, and valuable
paintings. After leaving this deserted place of royal worship,
we passed through the Halls of Plenty, Venus, Mars, Mercury,
Apollo, and the Hall of the Billiard Table, finely
painted by Houasse, le Brun, Champagne, and other eminent
artists, to the grand gallery, which is seventy-two
yards long, and fourteen broad, and has seventeen lofty windows
on one side, which look into the gardens, and seventeen
immense pier glasses on the opposite side to correspond.
In this gallery, the kings of France were accustomed to receive
ambassadors, and ministers of state.</p>

<p>We next entered the bedroom of the late queen and beheld
the door, which, on the night of the 6th of October,
1789, the frantic, and sanguinary mob, headed by the in<span class='pagenum'>181</span>famous
Legendre, burst open, for the purpose of dispatching
her with daggers, in her bed, on that frightful night, which
preceded the return of the royal family to Paris, under the
protection of the marquis de la Fayette, through an enraged
multitude, which extended itself from Versailles to Paris.</p>

<p>The miserable queen saved herself by escaping into an adjoining
apartment. Her bed was pierced through and through
with poignards. The door is nailed up, but the marks of that
horrible outrage still remain. In this, and in the adjoining
chambers, are some very beautiful and valuable paintings. I
must not omit to mention, although the sentiment which it inspires
is not very pleasant, the representation of the capture of
an english frigate, by la Bayonne, a french corvette, after a
desperate engagement, in which victory for once decided in
favour of the enemy, who opposed, on this occasion, an inferior
force. This is a picture of infinite merit, and possesses a
novelty of arrangement, and strength of colouring, which I
never saw equalled in any other naval representation. The
subject seldom admits of much variety. The french, of course,
are very much pleased with it. There are here also some
curious old clocks.</p>

<p>It was in one of these apartments, that Prior, the celebrated
poet, when secretary to the earl of Portland, who
was appointed ambassador to the french court, in the year
1698, made the following memorable answer.</p>

<p>One of the french king's household was showing the bard
the royal apartments and curiosities of this palace, and particularly
pointed out to his notice, the paintings of le Brun, now<span class='pagenum'>182</span>
removed to the <span class="correction" title="musuem">museum</span> of the arts, in which the victories
of
Lewis the XIVth are described, and asked him, whether the
actions of king William were to be seen in his palace? No,
sir, replied the loyal wit, "the monuments of my master's
glory are to be seen every where but in his own house."</p>

<p>Through the interest of Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; we were admitted
into a private room below stairs, in which several portraits of
the late royal family have been preserved from destruction,
during the late revolution. That which represents the queen
and her young family, is very fine, and displays all the bewitching
beauty and vivacity of that lovely and unfortunate
personage. Into this room no one was admitted with us.
Here is a very curious piece of mechanism: it is a painting,
containing two hundred little figures, in the act of enjoying
the various pleasures of rural sport, which are separated
from the back ground of the picture, and are set in motion by
springs; and admirably imitate all the movements natural to
their different occupations. A fisherman throws in his line,
and draws up a little fish, a regular chase is displayed, and a
nuptial procession appears, in which little figures, riding in
tiny carriages, nod to the spectators. There are also many
other curious figures. It is glazed and framed, and at a distance,
when its motion has ceased, it has the appearance of a
tolerably good painting. We next quitted the palace, and entered
upon the grand terrace, from which it makes the finest
appearance.</p>

<p>This enormous pile of building is here united by a centre,
and corresponding wings, of great extent and magnificence.<span class='pagenum'>183</span></p>

<p>From this elevated spot, the beholder contemplates the different
waterworks, walks, and gardens, which cover several
miles.</p>

<p>The orangery is a beautiful specimen of tuscan architecture,
designed by le Maitre, and finished by Mansart. It is filled
with lofty orange trees in full bearing; many of which, in
their tubs, measure from twenty to thirty feet high. Amongst
them is an orange tree which is upwards of four hundred
years old. The cascades, fountains, and jets d'eau, are too
numerous to admit of minute description. They are all very
fine, and are supplied by prodigious engines across the Seine,
at Marli, about three miles distant. The Trianon is a little
marble palace, of much beauty, and embellished with the
richest decoration.</p>

<p>It stands at the end of the great lake, in front of the palace;
and was, by its late royal owners, considered as a summer
house to the gardens of Versailles. The whole of this vast
building and its grounds, were improved and beautified by
Lewis XIVth, for the well known purpose of impressing his
subjects, and particularly his courtiers, with the highest opinion
of his greatness, and the lowest of their comparative littleness.
Amongst the lords of his court he easily effected his wishes, by
accommodating them in a manner unsuitable to their dignity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><a name="Ruins" id="Ruins"></a>Ruins of the Queen&#39;s Farm-house in the Petit Trianon.</span>
</div>

<p>After being astonished at such a display of gorgeous magnificence,
I approached, with increased delight, the enchanting
little palace and grounds of the late queen, distant from Versailles
about two miles, called the Petit Trianon, to which she
very justly gave the appellation of her "little Palace of Taste."<span class='pagenum'>184</span>
Here, fatigued with the splendours of royalty, she threw aside
all its appearances, and gave herself up to the elegant pleasures
of rural life. It is a princely establishment in miniature. It
consists of a small palace, a chapel, an opera house, out offices
and stables, a little park, and pleasure grounds; the latter of
which are still charming, although the fascinating eye, and
tasteful hand of their lovely but too volatile mistress, no longer
pervade, cherish and direct their growth and beauty. By
that reverse of fortune, which the revolution has familiarized,
the Petit Trianon is let out by the government to a restaurateur.
All the rooms but one in this house were preoccupied, on the
day of our visit, in consequence of which we were obliged to
dine in the former little bed room of the queen, where, like
the idalian goddess, she used to sleep in a suspended basket
of roses. The apertures in the <span class="correction" title="cieling">ceiling</span> and wainscot, to
which
the elegant furniture of this little room of repose had once
adhered, are still visible.</p>

<p>After dinner we hastened through our coffee, and proceeded
to the gardens. After winding through gravelled walks, embowered
by the most exquisite and costly shrubs, we entered
the elegant temple of Cupid, from which the little favourite
of mankind had been unwillingly, and rudely expelled, as
appeared by the fragments of his pedestal.</p>

<p>Thy wrongs little god! shall be revenged by thy fair friend
Pity. Those who treated thee thus, shall suffer in their turn,
and she shall not console them!</p>

<p>From this temple we passed through the most romantic avenues,
to a range of rural buildings, called the queen's farm,<span class='pagenum'>185</span>
the dairy, the mill, and the woodmens cottages; which, during
the queen's residence at the Petit Trianon, were occupied
by the most elegant and accomplished young noblemen of the
court. In front of them, a lake terminated on one side by a
rustic tower, spreads itself. These buildings are much neglected,
and are falling into rapid ruin.</p>

<p>In other times, when neatness and order reigned throughout
this elysian scenery, and gracefully spread its luxuriant beauties
at the feet of its former captivating owner, upon the mirror
of that lake, now filled with reeds and sedges, in elegant
little pleasure boats, the illustrious party was accustomed to
enjoy the freshness of the evening, to fill the surrounding
groves with the melody of the song, which was faintly answered
by the tender flute, whose musician was concealed in
that rustic tower, whose graceful base the honeysuckle and
eglantine no longer encircle, and whose winding access, once
decorated with flowers of the richest beauty and perfume, is
now overgrown with moss, decayed, and falling piecemeal to
the ground.</p>

<p>Near the farm, in corresponding pleasure grounds, the
miller's house particularly impressed us with delight. All its
characteristics were elegantly observed. A rivulet still runs
on one side of it, which formerly used to turn a little wheel
to complete the illusion. The apartments, which must have
been once enchanting, now present nothing but gaping beams,
broken ceilings, and shattered casements. The wainscots of
its little cabinets, exhibit only a tablet, upon which are rudely<span class='pagenum'>186</span>
penciled, the motley initials, love verses, and memorandums of
its various visitors.</p>

<p>The shade of the ivy, which, upon all occasions, seems
destined to perform the last offices to the departing monuments
of human ingenuity, has here exercised its gloomy function.
Whilst we were roving about, we were obliged to take refuge
from a thunder storm, in what appeared to us a mere barn;
upon our entering it, we found it to be an elegant little ball
room, much disfigured, and greened over by damp and neglect.
In other parts of this <i>petit Paradis</i>, are caves of artificial rock,
which have been formed at an immense expense, in which
were formerly beds of moss, and through which clear streams
of water glided, Belvidere temples, and scattered cottages,
each differing from its neighbour in character, but all according
in taste and beauty. The opera house, which stands alone,
is a miniature of the splendid one in the palace of Versailles.</p>

<p>The sylvan ball room, is an oblong square, lined with
beautiful treillages, surmounted with vases of flowers. The
top is open. When the queen gave her balls here, the
ground was covered by a temporary flooring, and the whole
was brilliantly lighted. As we passed by the palace, we saw,
in the queen's little library, several persons walking.</p>

<p>Could the enchanting beauty of Austria, and the once incensed
idol of the gay, and the gallant, arise from her untimely
tomb, and behold her most sacred recesses of delight,
thus rudely exposed, and converted into scenes of low, and
holiday festivity, the temples which she designed, defaced,<span class='pagenum'>187</span>
their statues overthrown, her walks overgrown and entangled,
the clear mirror of the winding lake, upon the placid surface
of which once shone the reflected form of the Belvidere, and
the retreats of elegant taste covered with the reedy greenness
of the standing pool, and all the <i>fairy fabric</i> of her graceful
fancy, thus dissolving in decay; the devoted hapless Marie
would add another sigh to the many which her aching heart
has already heaved!</p>

<p>It would be a very desirable thing if Bonaparte would make
this his country palace instead of St. Cloud. Upon our return,
as we approached Paris, the illuminated bridges of the Seine
looked very beautiful, and we were much pleased with some
fireworks, which had a singular effect upon the water.</p>

<p>In the evening, we had some music at Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;'s,
where we were joined by general Marescot, a brave and distinguished
officer, much esteemed by Bonaparte. He informed
us that he was on the point of setting out to view and report
the condition of all the maritime fortifications in the republic.
"You must go with me as my aide-de-camp," said the general
to Mademoiselle D&mdash;&mdash;. "I am not fierce enough for a soldier,"
replied the fair one, with a bewitching smile. "Well
then," observed the sun-browned general, "should the war
ever be renewed, you shall attend me to charm away its
calamities."</p>

<p>Madame S&mdash;&mdash;, like a true french mother, was delighted
with the little compliment, and presenting her snuff box to
the gallant Marescot, she said, "thank you, my dear general,
the brave always think generously of the fair."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>The first consul is said to add to his other extraordinary
powers, an acute and comprehensive knowledge of finance.
Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; informed me, that whenever he waited
upon him in his official capacity, with the national accounts,
he displayed an acquaintance with the most complicated
statements, which seemed intuitive.</p>

<p>He exhibits the same talents in philosophy, and in matters
which are foreign to those vast objects of public employ,
which have raised him to his present height of glory,
and which in general preclude the subordinate enjoyment of
elegant study.</p>

<p>Those acquirements, which providence in its wisdom has
thinly scattered amongst mankind, and which seldom ripen
to full maturity, although cherished by the most propitious
advantages, and by the unreposing labours of a long, and
blissful existence, spread their rich abundance, in the May
morning of life, before this extraordinary being, who in the
commencement of that very revolution, upon the ruins of which
he has stepped to supreme authority, was a beardless stripling.<span class='pagenum'>189</span></p>

<p>From the great performers upon the public stage of life,
our conversation, one evening, at Madame S&mdash;&mdash;'s, by a
natural transition, embraced a review of the wonderful talents,
which have at various times adorned the lesser drama of
the theatre. Madame S&mdash;&mdash; made some judicious remarks
upon the french players of distinction, to all of whom she
imputed a manner, and enunciation which have been imbibed
in a school, in which nature has not been permitted
to preside. Their tragedy, she said, was inflated with too
much pomp, and their elegant comedy suffered by too volatile
an airiness. She bestowed upon our immortal Garrick,
the most decided preference, and superiority to any actor
whom she had ever seen. The opportunity which she had
of judging of his powers, was short, and singular, but fully
enabled her to form a decisive opinion. When Garrick visited
Paris for the last time, she was just married. This celebrated
actor had letters of introduction to Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;.
At a large party, which Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash; formed for the
purpose of doing honour to his distinguished visitor, he exhibited
several specimens of his unrivalled talents. Amongst
others, he represented in dumb show, by the wonderful
powers of his expressive countenance, the feelings of a father,
who in looking over a lofty balcony with his only
child in his arms, by accident dropped it. The disaster drove
the unhappy parent mad. Garrick had visited him in his
cell; where the miserable maniac was accustomed, several
times in the course of the day, to exhibit all those looks<span class='pagenum'>190</span>
and attitudes which he had displayed at the balcony<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. On a
sudden he would bend himself forward, as if looking from a
window into the street, with his arms folded as if they embraced
a child, then he would start back, and appear as if he
had lost something, search the room round and round, run
again forward, as to the railing of a window, look down, and
beat his forehead, as if he had beheld his infant bleeding,
and breathless upon the pavement. Garrick's imitation was
exquisite. The feelings of his beholders were wrought up to
horror. The tears, and consternation of a gay fashionable
french party, were applauses more flattering to the british
Roscius, than the thunder of that acclamation, which, in the
crowded theatre, followed the flash of his fiery eye, or the
close of his appalling speech.</p>

<p>The english drama, however, has not escaped the animadversions
of a french critic, whose taste and liberality
are not very congenial with those of my charming, and
generous friend. "Their tragedies," he says, (speaking of
the english) "it is true, though interesting, and replete with
beauties, are nevertheless dramatic monsters, half <i>butchery</i>,
and half <i>farce</i>. Grotesque characters, and extravagant pleasantry
constitute the chief part of their comedies. In one
of them, (not named) the devil enters sneezing, and
somebody says to the devil, <i>God bless you</i>. They are not,
however, all of this stamp. They have <i>even some</i> in very
good taste."<span class='pagenum'>191</span></p>

<p>Yes, Monsieur Dourx, I agree with you, I think we
have <i>some</i> in very good taste. I know not in what dramatic
work the facetious frenchman has discovered the introduction
of his satanic majesty under the influence of a
cold, and receiving, as he enters, the usual deprecation on
such occasions. I rather suspect that the adventures of Punch,
and his fickle lady, who are always attended by a dancing
demon, have afforded the materials for this sapient observation.</p>

<p>In the course of one of my morning rambles in Paris,
I visited the ruins of the celebrated Bastille, of which prison,
only the arsenal, some fragments of its massy walls, and two
or three dungeons remain. The volcanic vengeance of the
people, has swept away this mighty fabric, which the revolting
mind of republican liberty denounced as the frightful
den of despotism, upon the approach to which no marks of
returning footsteps were imprinted, whilst, in her mad career,
she converted every private dwelling in the metropolis
into a revolutionary prison: So much for popular consistency!</p>

<p>In the mutations of time, to what different purposes are the
same places applied! Where the consuming martyr expired<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
the unwieldy prize hog is exposed to sale; and the modern
parisian derives the sources of warmth and comfort, from a
place, the very name of which, once <i>chilled</i> the circulation
of his blood. The site of the Bastille is now a magazine
of wood, which supplies the city with fuel.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>192</span></p>
<p>Every lover of pure liberty must leap with delight upon
the disincumbered earth, where once stood that gloomy
abode of "broken hearts," and reflect upon the sufferings of
the wretched Latude, and the various victims of capricious
pique, or prostitute resentment. It was here that, in the
beautiful lines of Cowper, the hopeless prisoner was doomed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To fly for refuge from distracting thought</span>
<span class="i0">To such amusements as ingenious woe</span>
<span class="i0">Contrives, hard shifting, and without her tools&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To read, engraven on the mouldy walls,</span>
<span class="i0">In stagg'ring types, his predecessor's tale,</span>
<span class="i0">A sad memorial, and subjoin his own&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">Is made familiar, watches his approach,</span>
<span class="i0">Comes at his call, and serves him for a friend&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>The cells of the Bastille were constantly filled, during the
syren reign of la Pompadour over the gloomy affections of
Lewis the XVth.</p>

<p>The overthrow of this dungeon has not rendered state
prisons out of fashion in the republic, although it has mitigated
the severity of their internal government. The towers
of the Temple, look down upon the prostrate ruins of the
Bastille.</p>

<p>From this memorable spot of ground, I went to the Observatory.
In the rooms, which open upon an artificial ter<span class='pagenum'>193</span>race,
were some prodigious astronomical apparatus. A very
ingenious frame was then constructing, for elevating, or depressing
the astronomer, and the telescope at the same time,
by an easy, and simple process of machinery. The Observatory
is a noble building, and contains libraries, students
rooms, and apartments for the various artificers, and machinists
who are occupied in fabricating the apparatus, and instruments
necessary to the science of astronomy. From the
exterior of the dome, there is a fine view of the city, suburbs,
and country.</p>

<p>From the Observatory, I visited the Conservative Senate,
formerly the Palace of the Luxembourg. The back of this
beautiful building is in the Rue de Vaugirand, in the Fauxbourg
of St. Germains. The gardens of this noble pile, are
receiving great improvement, and alteration, from designs
which have been approved of by the first consul, who in
his wise policy, intends that they shall, in time, rival those
of the Thuilleries, for the purpose of affording an elegant,
and fashionable promenade to the people who reside in this
part of the capital, who are considerably removed from the
beautiful walks which adorn the consular palace. Here I
saw the Hall of Deliberation, in which the Conservative Senate
assembles. It is nothing more than a large, handsome
drawing-room, in which are placed, upon rising platforms,
sixty armed chairs, for so many members, the chair of the
president, and the tribune. This magnificent palace is repairing,
and fitting up for the residence, and accommodation
of its members. I was introduced to the artist who has the<span class='pagenum'>194</span>
care of the gallery here, and who, with his assistants, was
very busily occupied in a process for removing the oil colours
of a painting from wood, and transferring them to
canvas. He received me with great politeness, and explained
to me the mode of doing it, in which there appeared to
be more toil, nicety, and steadiness required, than ingenuity.</p>

<p>The painting is laid upon a cloth stretched upon a marble
slab, and the wood behind is shaved off until nothing but
the picture, like a flat cake, or rather a sheet of goldbeater's
skin, remains, a piece of canvas coated with a cement is
then placed upon it, to which it adheres, and presents all
the appearance of having been originally painted upon it.
The pictures from the subject of St. Bruno, were then undergoing
this operation.</p>

<p>The apartments in which these people were at work, presented
very convincing indications of the mutability of human
ambition.</p>

<p>This palace was allotted to the celebrated Council of Five
Hundred. During their ephemeral reign, these very rooms
were designed for their halls of audience, and levees, the
rich mouldings, and cornices of which were half gilt, and
covered with silver paper to preserve them: the poor council
were never indulged in a house warming.</p>

<p>The pictures, which were collected by Henry IV, and
deposited in the gallery there, which bears his name, are
said to be valuable. I did not see them, on account of
their having been removed into store rooms during the repairs
of the palace.<span class='pagenum'>195</span></p>

<p>It was late when I left the Luxembourg, and somewhat
exhausted for want of refreshment, I determined upon dining
at the first restaurateur's which I could meet with, instead of
going to the Gardens of the Thuilleries. To find such an
accommodation in Paris, is no difficult thing. A stranger
would naturally suppose, from the frequency with which the
words caff&eacute;, limonade, and restaurateur present themselves to
the eye, that three parts of the inhabitants had turned their
talents to the valuable study of relieving the cravings of an
empty stomach.</p>

<p>I had not moved three yards down the Rue de Tournon,
before, on my left, I saw the welcome board which, in large
golden characters, announced the very best entertainment
within. At this moment, the celebrated picture of the banquet
in the Louvre, could <span class="correction" title="scarely">scarcely</span> have afforded me more
delight. I had an excellent dinner, wine, and fruit for four
livres. In the course of my repast, I begged that a knife,
might be permitted to aid the services of a three pronged
silver fork, which graced my plate on the left. After rather
a laborious search, my wishes were gratified by an instrument,
which certainly was entitled to the name of one, but
was assuredly not the handsomest of its species. Whether
there had been any dispute between the handle, and the
blade, I know not, but there were very evident appearances
of an approaching separation. Not wishing to augment the
rupture, between two personages so necessary to each others
service, and to those who were to be benefitted by it, I
begged of my fair hostess, who, with two pretty girls (her<span class='pagenum'>196</span>
daughters), were picking the stalks from some strawberries,
which were intended for my desert, at the other end of the
room, that she would favour me with another knife. The
maitresse d'h&ocirc;tel, who had a pair of fine dark expressive eyes,
very archly said, "Why would you wish to change it, Sir?
it is an english one." It certainly looked like one; no
compliment could be neater. Whether I gave it too great
a latitude of interpretation, I will not pretend to say, but it
led me into such a train of happy <i>comparative thinking</i>, that
I ate my dinner with it very comfortably, without saying
another word. I have since thought, that the maitresse
d'h&ocirc;tel had not another knife in her house, but what was
in use.</p>

<p>In France, I have before had occasion to remark, that
fanciful notions of excessive delicacy, are not permitted to
interfere with comfort, and convenience. Amongst these
people, every thing turns upon the principle of accommodation.
To this motive I attribute the frequent exhibition,
over the doors of respectable looking houses, in the fashionable
walks, and in different parts of Paris, of the following
characters, "Commodit&eacute;s pour Hommes, et Femmes." An
english prude would start to read these words. I mention
this circumstance, for the purpose of communicating some
idea of the people, convinced, as I well am, that it is only
by detail, that we can become acquainted with the peculiar
characteristics of any community.</p>

<p>I very often passed by the ci-devant Hall of the National
Convention; in which the hapless king and queen were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
doomed to the scaffold, where murder was legitimated, religion
denounced, and the grave declared to be the bed of
<i>eternal repose</i>.</p>

<p>In vindication of the ways of eternal justice, even upon
earth, this polluted pile is participating the fate of its devoted
members.</p>

<p>Those walls which once resounded with the florid, <span class="errata" title="heightened">high toned</span>
declamation of republican visionaries, the most worthless, imposing,
and desperate of mankind, are prevented, for a short
time, by a few crazy props, from covering the earth below
with their dust and ruins. The famed temple of the Goddess
of Liberty, is not tenantable enough to cover the Babel Deity
from the peltings of the midnight storm.</p>

<p>Where is now the enthusiastic Gironde, where the volcanic
mountain, the fiery, and eloquent Mirabeau, the wily Brissot,
the atheistic Lequinios, the remorseless Marat, the bloody St.
Just, and the chief of the deplumed and fallen legions of
equality? All is desolate and silent. The gaping planks of
the guillotine are imbued with their last traces. The haunt
of the banditti is uncovered. The revolution has preyed upon
her own children, and metaphysical murderers have perished
by the daggers of speculative republicans.</p>

<p>About two years since this place was converted into a m&eacute;nagerie.
The cave, and the wilderness, the desert, and the
jungle, presented to the eye of the beholder, representative
successors of those savages who, with more powers and more
ferocity, were once enclosed within the same den. From the
remembrance of such miscreants, I turn, with increased satis<span class='pagenum'>198</span>faction,
to the traces of approaching civilization, which mark
the career of the present government, in which the want of
suitable splendour no longer repels the approach and friendship
of those nations which once shuddered at the idea of coming
into contact with the infected rags of visionary fraternity. Some
indications of this change I saw pourtrayed at the levee of
Monsieur Talleyrand, the minister of foreign relations, when I
had the honour of being presented to that able and celebrated
politician by Mr. B. The hotel of Talleyrand is very superb.
We entered the court yard through two lines of about twenty
carriages in waiting. Under the portico, were several turks
seated, who formed a part of the suite of the turkish embassador,
who had just arrived, and was then closetted with Monsieur
T&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>We passed through several noble apartments, preceded by
servants, to a magnificent levee room, in which we met most
of the foreign embassadors who were then at the consular
court.</p>

<p>After waiting some time, the folding doors of the cabinet
opened, the turkish embassy came out, making their grand
salams, followed by Talleyrand, in his rich costume of embroidered
scarlet, his hair full dressed, and a shining sabre by his
side.</p>

<p>In his person, he is small and thin, his face is "pale and
penetrating." He always looks obliquely, his small quick
eyes and features, very legibly express mildness, wit, and subtilty.
His right leg appears contracted. His address is insinuating.
As the spirit of aggrandizement, which is said to have<span class='pagenum'>199</span>
actuated the public and private conduct of Monsieur T&mdash;&mdash;
has been so much talked of, it may, perhaps, excite some
surprise, when it is mentioned that several persons who know
him well, some of whom esteem him, and with some of whom
he is not a favourite, declare, notwithstanding the anecdotes
related of X Y, and Monsieur Beaucoup d'Argent, in the american
prints, that they consider him to be a man, whose mind
is raised above the influence of corruption. Monsieur T&mdash;&mdash;
may be classed amongst the rarest curiosities in the revolutionary
cabinet. Allied by an illustrious ancestry to the
Bourbons, and a royalist from his birth, he was, with unusual
celerity, invested with the episcopal robe and crosier<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. During
the temporary triumph of the abstract rights of man, over the
practicable rights of reason, he moved with the boisterous cavalcade,
with more caution than enthusiasm. Upon the celebrated
national recognition of the sovereignty of man's <i>will</i>, in
the Champs de Mars, the politic minister, adorned in snowy
robes, and tricolor ribands, presided at the altar of the republic
as its high priest, and bestowed his patriarchal benedictions
upon the standard of France, and the banners of her departments.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, in the shape of a secret unaccredited
negotiator, he was discovered in the metropolis of England,
and immediately transferred, upon the spread wings of the
alien bill, to his own shores. Since that period, after having
dissociated and neutralized the most formidable foes of his
country, by the subtle stratagems of his consummate diplo<span class='pagenum'>200</span>macy,
we beheld him as the successor of la Croix, armed
with the powers, and clothed in the gaudy costume of the
minister of foreign relations. In the <i>polished Babel</i> of the antichamber
of this extraordinary man, I have beheld the starred
and glittering representatives of the most distinguished princes
of the earth waiting for hours, with exemplary resignation,
contemplating themselves, in all their positions, in his reduplicating
mirrors, or examining the splendour and exquisite ingenuity
of his time pieces, until the silver sound of his little
bell announced, that the invoked and lagging moment of ministerial
leisure was arrived.</p>

<p>It is certain that few people possess the valuable qualities
of imperturbable calmness and self possession, more than
Monsieur T&mdash;&mdash;. Balanced by these amiable and valuable
qualities, he has been enabled to ride the political whirlwind,
and in the diplomatic cabinet, to collect some advantage from
the prejudices or passions of all who approached him. The
caution and cunning of T&mdash;&mdash; have succeeded, where the
sword and impetuous spirit of Bonaparte would have been
unavailing. The splendour of his apartments, and of many
of the personages present, displayed a very courtlike appearance,
and inclined a stranger, like myself, to think, that nothing
of the old government was missing, but the expatriated
family of France.<span class='pagenum'>201</span></p>

<p>I had long anticipated the delight which I expected to derive
from the interesting public lecture of the abb&eacute; Sicard,
and the examination of his pupils. This amiable and enlightened
man presides over an institution which endears his
name to humanity, and confers unfading honour upon the nation
which cherishes it by its protection and munificence.
My reader will immediately conclude that I allude to the College
of the Deaf and Dumb. By the genius and perseverance
of the late abb&eacute; Charles Michael de l'Ep&eacute;e, and his present
amiable successor, a race of fellow beings, denied by a privation
of hearing, of the powers of utterance, insulated in the
midst of multitudes bearing their own image, and cut off from
the participation, within sight, of all the endearing intercourses
of social life, are restored, as it were, to the blessings
of complete existence. The glorious labours of these philanthropists,
in no very distant ages, would have conferred upon
them, the reputation and honours of beings invested with
superhuman influence. By making those faculties which are
bestowed, auxiliary to those which are denied, the deaf are
taught to hear, and the dumb to speak. A silent representative<span class='pagenum'>202</span>
language, in which the eye officiates for the ear, and communicates
the charms of science, and the delights of common
intercourse to the mind, with the velocity, facility, and certainty
of sound, has been presented to these imperfect children
of nature. The plan of the abb&eacute;, I believe, is before the
world. It cannot be expected, in a fugitive sketch like the
present, to attempt an elaborate detail of it. Some little idea
of its rudiments may, perhaps, be imparted, by a plain description
of what passed on the examination day, when I had
the happiness of being present.</p>

<p>On the morning of the exhibition, the streets leading to the
College were lined with carriages, for humanity has here made
a convert of fashion, and directed her wavering mind to objects
from which she cannot retire, without ample and consoling
gratification. Upon the lawn, in front of the College,
were groups of the pupils, enjoying those sports and exercises
which are followed by other children, to whom Providence
has been more bountiful. Some of their recreations
required calculation, and I observed that their intercourse
with each other appeared to be easy, swift, and intelligible.
They made some convulsive movements with their mouths, in
the course of their communication, which, at first, had rather
an unpleasant effect. In the cloister I addressed myself to a
genteel looking youth, who did not appear to belong to the
College, and requested him to shew me the way to the theatre,
in which the lecture was to be delivered. I found he took
no notice of me. One of the assistants of the abb&eacute;, who was
standing near me, informed me, he was deaf and dumb, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
made two or three signs, too swift for me to discriminate;
the silent youth bowed, took me by the hand, led me into the
theatre, and, with the greatest politeness, procured me an excellent
seat. The room was very crowded, and in the course
of a quarter of an hour after I had entered, every avenue
leading to it was completely filled with genteel company.
The benches of the auditors of the lecture, displayed great
beauty and fashion, a stage, or tribune, appeared in front,
behind was a large inclined slate, in a frame, about eight feet
high, by six long. On each side of the stage the scholars
were placed, and behind the spectators was a fine bust of the
founder of the institution, the admirable de l'Ep&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The abb&eacute; Sicard mounted the tribune, and delivered his
lecture with very pleasing address, in the course of which he
frequently excited great applause. The subject of it was an
analysis of the language of the deaf and dumb, interspersed
with several curious experiments upon, and anecdotes of his
pupils. The examination of the scholars next followed. The
communication which has been opened to them in this singular
manner, is by the <i>philosophy of grammar</i>.</p>

<p>The denotation of the tenses <span class="errata" title="is">was</span> effected by appropriate signs.
The hand thrown over the shoulder, expressed the past, when
extended, like the attitude of inviting, it denoted the future,
and the finger inverted upon the breast, indicated the present
tense. A single sign communicated a word, and frequently a
sentence. A singular instance of the first occurred. A gentleman
amongst the spectators, who appeared to be acquainted
with the art of the abb&eacute;, was requested to make a sign, to<span class='pagenum'>204</span>
the pupil then under examination, the moment it was made,
the scholar chalked upon the slate, in a fine swift flowing
hand, "une homme." The pupil erred; the gentleman renewed
the sign; when he immediately wrote, "une personne,"
to the astonishment of every person present. This circumstance
is a strong instance of the powers of discrimination, of
which this curious communication is susceptible.</p>

<p>Some of the spectators requested the abb&eacute; to describe, by
signs, several sentences which they repeated from memory, or
read from authors, which were immediately understood by the
pupils, and penciled upon the slate.</p>

<p>The lecture and examination lasted about three hours. Upon
the close of this interesting exhibition, a silent sympathy reigned
throughout the spectators. Every face beamed with satisfaction.
A tear was seen trembling in the eyes of many present. After
a momentary pause, the hall rang with acclamations. Elegant
women pressed forward in the crowd, to present some little
token of their delighted feelings to the children protected by
this institution. It was a spectacle, in which genius was observed
assisting humanity, and nature in a suffusion of gratitude,
weeping over the hallowed and propitious endeavours of
the good, the generous, and the enlightened. Well might
the elegant and eloquent Kotzebue select from such a spot, a
subject for his pathetic pen, and give to the british Roscius of
the present day<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, the power of enriching its drama, by a
fresh display of his unrivalled abilities. The exhibition of the<span class='pagenum'>205</span>
Deaf and Dumb will never be eradicated from my mind. The
tears which were shed on that day, seemed almost sufficient
to wipe away the recollection of those times, in which misery
experienced no mitigation; when every one trembling for himself,
had no unabsorbed sensation of consoling pity to bestow
upon the unfortunate. Those times are gone&mdash;May their absence
be eternal! This institution is made serviceable to the
state. A pupil of the College is one of the chief clerks of the
national lottery office, in which he distinguishes himself by his
talents, his calculation, and upright deportment.</p>

<p>Whilst the subject is before me, I beg leave to mention a curious
circumstance which was related by a very ingenious and
honourable man, in a party where I happened to be present,
to prove the truth and agreement of nature, in her association
of ideas. A blind man was asked by him, to what sound
he resembled the sensation produced by touching a piece of
red cloth, he immediately replied, to the sound of a trumpet.
A pupil of the College of the Deaf and Dumb, who could faintly
hear a loud noise, if applied close to his ear, was asked, to what
colour he could compare the sound of a trumpet, he said, it
always excited in his mind, the remembrance of scarlet cloth<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
Two pupils, male and female, of the same College, who had
been placed near cannon, when discharged, without being
susceptible of the sound, were one day taken by their humane
tutor, into a room where the harmonica was playing; a musical
instrument, which is said to have a powerful influence<span class='pagenum'>206</span>
over the nerves. He asked them by signs, if they felt any
sensation. They replied in the negative. He then placed the
hand of the girl upon the instrument, whilst it was playing,
and repeated the question, she answered, that she felt a new
pleasure enter the ends of her fingers, pass up her arms, and
penetrate her heart.</p>

<p>The same experiment was tried upon her companion, who
seemed to be sensible of similar sensations of delight, but less
acutely felt.</p>

<p>The emotions of sympathy are, perhaps, more forcibly excited
by music than by any other cause. An illustrious example
of its effect is introduced into Boerhaave's academical
lectures on the diseases of the nerves, published by Van Eems.
Theodosius the Great, by levying an excessive tribute, inflamed
the minds of the people of Antioch against him, who prostrated
his statues, and slew his ambassadors.</p>

<p>Upon coolly reflecting on what they had done, and remembering
the stern and ruthless nature of their sovereign,
they sent deputies to implore his clemency and forgiveness.
The tyrant received them, without making any reply. His
chief minister lamenting the condition of these unhappy people,
resolved upon an expedient to move the soul of his offended
prince to mercy. He accordingly instructed the youths whose
office it was to entertain the emperor with music during
dinner, to perform an affecting and pathetic piece of music,
composed for the purpose. The plaintive sounds soon began
to operate. The emperor, unconscious of the cause, bedewed
his cup with tears, and when the singers artfully proceeded to<span class='pagenum'>207</span>
describe the sufferings of the people of Antioch, their imperial
master could no longer contain himself, but, moved by their
pathos, although unaccustomed to forgive, revoked his vengeance,
and restored the terrified offenders to his royal favour.</p>

<p>Madame E&mdash;&mdash;, who is considered the first dilettante mistress
of music in Paris, related to me, an experiment which
she once tried upon a young woman who was totally deaf
and dumb. Madame E&mdash;&mdash; fastened a silk thread about her
mouth, and rested the other end upon her piano forte, upon
which she played a pathetic air. Her visitor soon appeared
much affected, and at length burst into tears. When she recovered,
she wrote down upon a piece of paper, that she had
experienced a delight, which she could not express, and that
it had forced her to weep.</p>

<p>I must reluctantly retire from this pleasing subject, by
wishing that the abb&eacute; may long enjoy a series of blissful years,
and that his noble endeavours, "manifesting the enlightened
times in which we live," may meet with that philanthropic
success, which, to <i>his</i> generous mind, will be its most desired
reward <i>here</i>; assured, as he is, of being crowned with those
unfading remunerations which are promised to the good <i>hereafter</i>.</p>

<span class="caption"><a name="Bagatelle" id="Bagatelle"></a>Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne.</span>
</div>

<p>I one day dined at Bagatelle, which is about four miles from
Paris, in the Bois du Bologne, the parisian Hyde Park, in which
the fashionable equestrian, upon his norman hunter,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"with heel insidiously aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Provokes the canter which he seems to chide."</span>
<span class='pagenum'>208</span></div>

<p>The duellist also, in the covert windings of this vast wood,
seeks reparation for the trifling wrong, and bleeds himself, or
slaughters his antagonist. Bagatelle was formerly the elegant
little palace of the count d'Artois. The gardens and grounds
belonging to it, are beautifully disposed. What a contrast to
the gloomy shades of Holyrood House, in which the royal
fugitive, and his wretched followers, have found an asylum!</p>

<p>The building and gardens are in the taste of the Petit
Trianon, but inferior to it. As usual, it is the residence of
cooks, and scullions, tenants of the government, who treat their
visitors with good dinners, and excellent wine, and take good
care to make them pay handsomely for their faultless fare.</p>

<p>Returning to my hotel rather late at night, I passed through
the Champs Elisees, which, at this hour, seemed to be
in all its glory. Every "alley green," was filled with whispering
lovers. On all sides the sounds of festivity, of music,
and dancing, regaled the ear. The weather was very sultry,
and being a little fatigued with rather a long walk, I entered
through a trellis palisade into a capacious pavilion, where I refreshed
myself with lemonade.</p>

<p>Here I found a large bourgeois party enjoying themselves,
after the labours of the day, with the waltz, and their favourite
beverage, lemonade. A stranger is always surprised at beholding
the grace, and activity, which even the lowest orders of
people in France, display in dancing. Whiskered corporals,
in thick dirty boots, and young tradesmen, in long great coats,
led off their respective femmes de chambre and grisettes, with
an elegance, which is not to be surpassed in the jewelled birth<span class='pagenum'>209</span>
night ball room. Nothing could exceed the sprightly carelessness,
and gay indifference which reigned throughout. The
music in this place, as in every other of a similar description,
was excellent.</p>

<p>The french police, notwithstanding the invidious rumours
which have been circulated to its prejudice, is the constant
subject of admiration with every candid foreigner, who is
enabled under the shelter of its protection, to perambulate
in safety every part of Paris, and its suburbs, although badly
lighted, at that hour of the night, which in England, seldom
fails to expose the unwary wanderer to the pistol of the
prowling ruffian. An enlightened friend of mine, very
shrewdly observed, that the english police seems to direct
its powers, and consideration more to the apprehension of
the robber, than to the prevention of the robbery. In no
country is the <i>art</i> of thief catching carried higher, than in
England. In France, the police is in the highest state of
respectability, and unites force to vigilance. The depredator
who is fortunate enough to escape the former, is seldom
able to elude the latter.</p>

<p>The grand National Library of Paris, is highly deserving
of a visit, and is considered to be the first of its kind in
Europe. In one of the rooms is a museum of antiques.
The whole is about to be removed to the old palace. In
one of the wings of this noble collection, are the two celebrated
great globes, which rest upon the ground, and rise
through the flooring of the first story, where there is a rail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>ing
round them. These globes I should suppose to be about
eighteen feet high.</p>

<p>From the Grand National Library, I went with a party to
the military review of all the regiments in Paris, and its
suburbs by the first consul, in the Place de Carousel, within
the gates, and railing which he has raised for this purpose.
We were introduced into the apartments of general Duroc, the
governor of the palace, which were upon the ground floor of the
Thuilleries, and which afforded us an uninterrupted view of the
whole of this superb military spectacle. A little before twelve
o'clock, all the regiments of horse and foot, amounting to about
7000 men, had formed the line, when the consular regiment
entered, preceded by their fine band, and the tambour major,
who was dressed in great magnificence. This man is remarked
in Paris for his symmetry and manly beauty. The cream-coloured
charger of Bonaparte, upon which, "labouring for
destiny, he has often made dreadful way in the field of battle,"
next passed us, led by grooms in splendid liveries of green
and gold, to the grand entrance. As the clock struck twelve,
the first consul, surrounded by a chosen body of the consular
guard, appeared and mounted. He immediately rode off in
full speed, to the gate nearest to the gallery of the Louvre,
followed by his favourite generals, superbly attired, mounted
upon chargers very richly caparisoned. My eye, aided by
a good opera-glass, was fixed upon the first consul. I beheld
before me a man whose renown is sounded through the remotest
regions of the earth, and whose exploits have been united
by the worshippers of favoured heroism to <span class="errata" title="text added">those of</span> the conqueror of<span class='pagenum'>211</span>
Darius. His features are small and meagre. His countenance
is melancholy, cold and desperate. His nose is aquiline. His
eyes are dark, fiery, and full of genius. His hair, which he
wears cropped and without powder, is black. His figure is
small, but very muscular. He wore a blue coat, with broad
white facings and golden epaulets (the uniform of his regiment)
a small cocked hat, in which was a little national
cockade. In his hand he carried a small riding whip. His
boots were made in the fashion of english riding boots, which
I have before condemned on account of their being destitute
of military appearance. The reason why they are preferred by
the french officers is on account of the top leather not soiling
the knees of the pantaloons when in the act of putting one leg
over the other. Bonaparte rode through the lines. His beautiful
charger seemed conscious of the glory of his rider, and bore
him through the ranks with a commanding and majestic pace.
The colours of one of the regiments was stationed close under
the window, where I had the good fortune of being placed.
Here the hero stopped, and saluted them. At this time I was
close to him, and had the pleasure of completely gratifying that
curiosity of beholding the persons of distinguished men, which
is so natural to all of us.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Bonaparte had passed, I saw a procession,
the history of which I did not understand at the time, but
which fully explained its general purport. About two years
since, one of the regiments of artillery revolted in battle. Bonaparte
in anger deprived them of their colours, and suspended
them, covered with crape, amongst the captive banners of the<span class='pagenum'>212</span>
enemy, in the Hall of Victory. The regiment, affected by the
disgrace, were determined to recover the lost esteem of their
general and their country, or perish to the last man. When
any desperate enterprise was to be performed, they volunteered
their services, and by this magnanimous compunction covered
their shame with laurels, and became the boast and pride of
the republican legions. This day was fixed upon for the
restoration of their ensigns. They were marched up under a
guard of honour, and presented to the first consul, who took
the black drapery from their staves, tore it in pieces, threw it
on the ground, and drove his charger indignantly over it. The
regenerated banners were then restored to the regiment, with
a short and suitable address. I faintly heard this laconic speech,
but not distinctly enough to offer any criticism upon the
eloquence of the speaker. This exhibition had its intended
effect, and displayed the genius of this extraordinary man, who,
with unerring acuteness, knows so well to give to every
public occurrence that dramatic hue and interest which are
so gratifying to the minds of the people over whom he presides.
After this ceremony, the several regiments, preceded by their
bands of music, marched before him in open order, and dropped
their colours as they passed. The flying artillery and cavalry
left the parade in full gallop, and made a terrific noise upon
the pavement. Each field-piece was drawn by six horses,
upon a carriage with large wheels. Here the review closed.</p>

<span class='pagenum'>213</span></div></div>

<p>Bonaparte returned to the palace, where he held a splendid
levee, at which the new turkish embassy was introduced.</p>

<p>In the evening I saw Bonaparte and his lady at the opera,
where he was received with respect, but without any clamorous
acclamation.</p>

<p>Madame Bonaparte appears to be older than the first consul.
She is an elegant woman, and is said to conduct herself in her
high station with becoming dignity and prudence.<span class='pagenum'>214</span></p>

<p>A neat remark was made upon the abb&egrave; Sieyes, to whose
prolific mind the revolution and all its changes have been imputed.
This extraordinary man has a noble house in the
Champs Elis&eacute;es, and is said to have the best cook in Paris.
As a party in which I was, were passing his hotel, a near
relation of the abb&egrave;, who happened to be with us, commented
upon the great services which the cloistered fabricator of
constitutions had afforded to France, and adverted to his house
and establishment as an unsuitable reward for his labours.
A gentleman, who was intimate with the abb&egrave;, but was no
great admirer of his morals, said, "I think, my dear madam,
the abb&egrave; ought to be very well satisfied with his destiny;
and I would advise him to live as long as he can in the
Champs Elis&eacute;es; for when he shall happen to experience
that mysterious transition to which we are all hastening,
I think the chances will be against his finding good accommodations
in any other Elysium."<span class='pagenum'>215</span></p>

<p>As I was passing one morning through the hall of the
Thuilleries, the great door of the council chamber was
opened, and the second and third consuls, preceded and followed
by their suite in full costume, <i>marched</i> with great
pomp to business, to the roll of a drum. This singular procession
from one part of the house to the other, had a ridiculous
effect, and naturally reminded me of the fustian
pageantry which, upon the stage, attends the entries and exits
of the kings and queens of the drama.</p>

<p>I have often been surprised to find that the injuries which
the cornice of the entrance, and the capitals of the columns
in the hall of the Thuilleries, have sustained from the ball
of cannon, during the horrible massacre of the 10th of August,
1792, have never been repaired. Every vestige of that day of
dismay and slaughter ought for ever to be effaced; instead
of which, some labour has been exercised to perpetuate its
remembrance. Under the largest chasms which have been
made by the shot is painted, in strong characters, that gloomy
date.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day of devastation, from which France
may date all her sufferings, a friend of mine went into the
court-yard of the Thuilleries, where the review is now held,
for the purpose of endeavouring to recognise, amongst the dead,
any of his acquaintances. In the course of this shocking
search, he declared to me, that he counted no less than eight
hundred bodies of Swiss and French, who had perished in that
frightful contest between an infatuated people and an irresolute
sovereign. I will not dilate upon this painful subject, but<span class='pagenum'>216</span>
dismiss it in the words of the holy and resigned descendant of
Nahor, "Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it
from above, neither let the light shine upon it; let darkness
and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let
the blackness of the day terrify it."</p>

<p>I have before had occasion to notice the promptitude and
activity of the french police, under the penetrating eye of
Mons. Fouche. No one can escape the vigilance of this man
and his emissaries. An emigrant of respectability assured me,
that when he and a friend of his waited upon him for their
passports to enable them to quit Paris for the South of France,
he surprised them by relating to them the names of the towns,
the streets, and of the people with whom they had lodged,
at various times, during their emigration in England.</p>

<p>Whilst I was at Paris, an affair happened very near the hotel
in which I lodged, which in its sequel displayed that high
spirit and sensibility which appear to form the presiding features
in the french character, to which may be attributed all the
excesses which have stained, and all the glory which has embellished
it. A lady of fortune, and her only daughter, an
elegant and lovely young woman, resided in the Fauxbourg
St. Germain. A young man of merit and accomplishments,
but unaided by the powerful pretensions of suitable fortune,
cherished a passion for the young lady, to whom he had frequent
access, on account of his being distantly related to her.
His affection was requited with return; and before the parent
suspected the attachment, the lovers were solemnly engaged.
The indications of pure love are generally too unguarded to<span class='pagenum'>217</span>
escape the keen, observing eye of a cold, mercenary mother.
She charged her daughter with her fondness, and forbade her
distracted lover the house. To close up every avenue of hope,
she withdrew with her wretched child into Italy, where they
remained for two years; at the expiration of which, the mother
had arranged for her daughter a match more congenial to her
own pride and avarice, with an elderly gentleman, who had
considerable fortune and property in the vicinity of Bourdeaux.
Every necessary preparation was made for this cruel union,
which it was determined should be celebrated in Paris, to which
city they returned for that purpose. Two days before the
marriage was intended to take place, the young lover, wrought
up to frenzy by the intelligence of the approaching nuptials,
contrived, by bribing the porter whilst the mother was at the
opera with her intended son-in-law, to reach the room of the
beloved being from whom he was about to be separated for
ever. Emaciated by grief, she presented the mere spectre of
what she was when he last left her. As soon as he entered
the room, he fell senseless at her feet, from which state he
was roused by the loud fits of her frightful maniac laughter.
She stared upon him, like one bewildered. He clasped her
with one hand, and with the other drew from his pocket a vial
containing double distilled laurel water: he pressed it to her
lips, until she had swallowed half of its contents; the remainder
he drank himself.&mdash;The drug of death soon began to operate.&mdash;Clasped
in each other's arms, pale and expiring, they reviewed
their hard fate, and, in faint and lessening sentences, implored
of the great God of mercy, that he would pardon them for<span class='pagenum'>218</span>
what they had done, and that he would receive their spirits
into his regions of eternal repose; that he would be pleased,
in his divine goodness, to forgive the misjudging severity which
had driven them to despair, and would support the unconscious
author of it, under the heavy afflictions which their disastrous
deaths would occasion. They had scarcely finished their prayer,
when they heard footsteps approaching the room. Madame
R&mdash;&mdash;, who had been indisposed at the opera, returned home
before its conclusion, with the intended bridegroom. The
young man awoke, as it were, from his deadly drowsiness,
and, exerting his last strength, pulled from his breast a dagger,
stabbed the expiring being, upon whom he doated, to the
heart; and, falling upon her body, gave himself several mortal
wounds. The door opened; the frantic mother appeared.
All the house was in an instant alarmed; and the fatal explanation
which furnished the materials of this short and sad
recital, was taken from the lips of the dying lover, who had
scarcely finished it before he breathed his last. Two days
afterwards, the story was hawked about the streets.</p>

<p>From this painful narrative, in which the French impetuosity
is strongly depicted, I must turn to mention my visit
to Mons. le G&mdash;&mdash;, who lives in the Rue Florentine, and
is considered to be one of the first architects in France; in
which are many monuments of his taste and elegance. It is
a curious circumstance that all artists exercise their talents
more successfully for their patrons than for themselves. Whether
it is the hope of a more substantial reward than that of mere
self-complacency, which usually excites the mind to its happiest<span class='pagenum'>219</span>
exertions, I will not pretend to determine; but the point seems
to be in some degree settled by the conduct of a celebrated
Bath physician, of whom it is related, that, happening once
to suffer under a malady from which as his skill had frequently
relieved others, he determined to prescribe for himself. The
recipe at first had not the desired effect. The doctor was
surprised. At last he recollected that he had not feed himself.
Upon making this discovery, he drew the strings of his purse,
and with his left hand placed a guinea in his right, and then
prescribed. The story concludes by informing its readers, that
the prescription succeeded, and the doctor recovered.&mdash;In
adorning the front of his own h&ocirc;tel, Mons. le G&mdash;&mdash;, in my
very humble opinion, has not exhibited his accustomed powers.
In a small confined court-yard he has attempted to give to
a private dwelling the appearance of one of those vast temples
of which he became enamoured when at Athens. The roof
is supported by two massy fluted pilastres, which in size are
calculated to bear the burthen of some prodigious dome. The
muscular powers of Hercules seem to be here exercised in
raising a grasshopper from the ground. The genius of Mons.
le G&mdash;&mdash;, unlike the world's charity, does not begin at home,
but seems more disposed to display its most successful energies
abroad. His roof, however, contains such a monument of his
goodness and generosity, that I must not pass it over. This
distinguished architect is one of those unfortunate beings who
have been decreed to taste the bitterness, very soon after the
sweets of matrimony. Upon discovering the infidelity of his
lady, who is very pretty and prepossessing, the distracted hus<span class='pagenum'>220</span>band
immediately sought a divorce from the laws of his country.
This affair happened a very short time before the revolution
afforded unusual acceleration and facilities to the wishes of
parties, who, under similar circumstances, wished to get rid of
each other as soon as possible. The then "law's delay" afforded
some cause of vexation to Mons. le G&mdash;&mdash;, who was deeply
injured. Before his suit had passed through its last forms, the
father of his wife, who at the time of their marriage lived
in great affluence, became a bankrupt. In the vortex of his
failure, all the means of supporting his family were swallowed
up. The generous le G&mdash;&mdash;, disdaining to expose to want and
ignominy the woman who had once been dear to him, would
proceed no further. She is still his wife; she bears his name,
is maintained by him, and in a separate suite of apartments
lives under the same roof with him. But Mons. and Madame
le G&mdash;&mdash; have had no intercourse whatever with each other
for eleven years. If in the gallery or in the hall they meet
by accident, they pass without the interchange of a word.
This painful and difficult arrangement has now lost a considerable
portion of its misery, by having become familiar to
the unfortunate couple.</p>

<p>In the valuable and curious cabinet of Mons. le G&mdash;&mdash;, I
found out, behind several other casts, a bust of Robespierre,
which was taken of him, a short period before he fell. A
tyrant, whose offences look white, contrasted with the deep
delinquency of the oppressor of France, is said to be indebted
more to his character, than to nature, for the representation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of that deformity of person which appears in Shakspeare's
portrait of him, when he puts this soliloquy in his lips:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</span>
<span class="i0">Cheated of feature, by dissembling Nature,</span>
<span class="i0">Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the breathing world, scarce half made up;</span>
<span class="i0">And that so lamely and unfashionably,</span>
<span class="i0">That dogs bark at me, as I halt by them."</span>
</div></div>

<p>History, enraged at the review of the insatiable crimes of Robespierre,
has already bestowed upon him a fanciful physiognomy,
which she has composed of features which rather correspond
with the ferocity of his soul, than with his real countenance.
From the appearance of this bust, which is an
authentic <span class="errata" title="remblance">resemblance</span> of him, his face must have been rather
handsome. His features were small, and his countenance must
have strongly expressed animation, penetration and subtlety.
This bust is a real curiosity. It is very likely that not another
is now to be found, Mons. le G&mdash;&mdash; is permitted to preserve
it, without reproach on account of his art. I can safely say, he
does not retain it from any emotions of veneration for the
original. It is worthy of being placed between the heads of
Caligula and Nero. Very near the residence of Mons. le
G&mdash;&mdash; is the house in which Robespierre lodged. It is at
the end of the Rue Florentine, in the Rue St. Honore, at a wax
chandler's. This man is too much celebrated, not to render
every thing which relates to him curious. The front windows<span class='pagenum'>222</span>
of his former lodgings look towards the Place de la Concorde,
on the right of which his prime minister, the permanent guillotine,
was quartered. Robespierre, who, like the revolting
angel, before the world's formation, appears to have preferred
the sceptre of Hell and chaos, to the allegiance of order and
social happiness, will descend to posterity with no common
attributes of distinction and preeminence. His mind was fully
suited to its labours, which, in their wide sphere of mischief,
required more genius to direct them than was bestowed upon
the worst of the tyrants of Rome, and a spirit of evil which,
with its "broad circumference" of guilt, was calculated to
darken the disk of their less expanded enormity.</p>

<p>From Robespierre's lodgings, curiosity led me to visit the
building in which the jacobin club held their Pandemonium.
It is a noble edifice, and once belonged to the Order of Jacobins.
Near this church stands the beautiful fabric of the Corn Hall
of Paris, designed by Monsieur le Grand. The dome of the
bank of England is in the same style, but inferior, in point of
lightness and elegance. That of the Corn Hall resembles a
vast concavity of glass. In this noble building the millers
deposit their corn for sale. Its deep and lofty arches and
area, were nearly filled with sacks, containing that grain which
is precious to all nations, but to none more than the french;
to a frenchman, bread is most emphatically the staff of life.
He consumes more of it at one meal than an englishman does
at four. In France, the little comparative quantity of bread
which the english consume, is considered to form a part of
their national character. Before I left Paris, I was requested<span class='pagenum'>223</span>
to visit a very curious and interesting exhibition, the Museum
of French Monuments; for the reception of which, the ancient
convent of the monks of the Order of les Petits Augustines,
is appropriated. This national institution is intended
to exhibit the progress of monumental taste in France, for
several centuries past, the specimens of which have chiefly
been collected from St. Denis, which formerly was the burial
place of the monarchs of France, and from other churches.</p>

<span class="caption"><a name="Museum" id="Museum"></a>Museum of French Monuments.</span>
</div>

<p>It will be remembered by the reader, that in the year 1793,
Henriot, a vulgar and furious republican, proposed setting off
for the former church, at the head of the sans culottes, to
destroy all these curious and valuable relics, "to strike," as he
said, "the tyrants in their tombs," but was prevented by some
other republicans of influence, who had not parted with their
veneration for works of taste, from this impious and impotent
outrage.</p>

<p>In the first hall, which is very large, and impresses a similar
awe to that which is generally felt upon entering a cathedral,
are the tombs of the twelfth century. Amongst them I chiefly
distinguished that of Henry II, upon which are three beautiful
mourning figures, supporting a cup, containing his heart.</p>

<p>In the second hall, are the monuments of the thirteenth
century, most of them are very fine; that of Lewis the XIIth
and his queen, is well worthy of notice. I did not find much
to gratify me in the hall of the fourteenth century. In that
of the fifteenth century are several noble tombs, and beautiful
windows of stained glass. In the hall of the sixteenth century
is a fine statue of Henry the IVth, by Franchville, which is<span class='pagenum'>224</span>
considered to be an admirable likeness of that wonderful man.
In the hall of the seventeenth century, is a noble figure, representing
religion, by Girardon.</p>

<p>In the cloisters are several curious statues, stained glass
windows, and tesselated pavement. There is here also a good
bust of Alexis Peron, with this singular epitaph,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ci git qui ne fut rien,</span>
<span class="i0">Pas m&ecirc;me acad&eacute;micien.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the square garden within the cloisters, are several ancient
urns, and tombs. Amongst them is the vase which contains
the ashes, if any remain, of Abelard and Heloise, which has
been removed from the Paraclete to the Museum. It is covered
with the graceful shade of an Acacia tree, which seems to
wave proudly over its celebrated deposit. Upon approaching
this treasurable antique, all those feelings rushed in upon me,
which the beautiful, and affecting narrative of those disastrous
lovers, by Pope, has often excited in me. The melancholy
Heloise seemed to breathe from her tomb here,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If ever chance two wandering lovers brings,</span>
<span class="i0">O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,</span>
<span class="i0">And drink the falling tear each other sheds:</span>
<span class="i0">Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! may we never love, as these have lov'd."</span>
</div></div>

<p>National guards are stationed in every apartment of the Museum,
and present rather an unaccording appearance, amidst<span class='pagenum'>225</span>
the peaceful solemnity of the surrounding objects. This exhibition
is not yet completed, but, in its present condition, is
very interesting. Some hints, not altogether useless, may be
collected from it. In England, our churches are charnel
houses. The pews of the congregation are raised upon foundations
of putrefaction. For six days and nights the temple of
devotion is filled with the pestilent vapours of the dead, and on
the seventh they are absorbed by the living. Surely it is high
time to subdue prejudices, which endanger health without
promoting piety. The scotch never bury in their churches,
and their burial places are upon the confines of their towns.
The eye of adoration is filled with a pensive pleasure, in observing
itself surrounded with the endeavours of taste and ingenuity,
to lift the remembrance of the great and good beyond
the grave, in that very spot where the frailty of our nature
is so often inculcated.</p>

<p>Such a display, in such a place, is rational, suitable, and
admonitory. The silent tomb becomes auxiliary to the eloquence
of the pulpit. But the custom which converts the
place of worship into a catacomb, can afford but a mistaken
consolation to posthumous pride, and must, in some degree,
contaminate the atmosphere which is contained within its walls.
One evening as I was passing through the Boulevard Italien,
in company with a gentleman from Toulon, we met a tall,
dark, hollow eyed, ferocious looking man, of whom he related
the following story.</p>

<p>Immediately after the evacuation of Toulon by the english,
all the principal toulonese citizens were ordered to repair to<span class='pagenum'>226</span>
the market place; where they were surrounded by a great military
force.</p>

<p>This man who, for his offences, had been committed to
prison, was liberated by the french agents, in consequence of
his undertaking to select those of the inhabitants who had in
any manner favoured the capitulation of the town, or who had
shown any hospitality to the english, whilst they were in possession
of it. The miscreant passed before the citizens, who
were drawn out in lines, amounting to near three thousand.
Amongst whom he pointed out about one thousand four hundred
persons to the fury of the government; without any other
evidence, or further examination, they were all immediately
adjudged to be shot. For this purpose a suitable number of
soldiers were drawn out. The unhappy victims were marched
up to their destruction, upon the quay, in sets of three hundred,
and butchered.</p>

<p>The carnage was dreadful. In the last of these unfortunate
groups, were two gentlemen of great respectability, who received
no wound from the fire, but, to preserve themselves,
dropped with the rest, and exhibited all the appearances of
having participated in the general fate.</p>

<p>This execution took place in the evening: immediately after
its close, the soldiers, fatigued, and sick with cold-blooded
slaughter, marched back to their quarters, without examining
whether every person upon whom they had fired, had fallen
a victim to the murderous bullet. Soon after the soldiers
had retired, the women of Toulon, allured by plunder, proceeded
to the fatal spot. Mounted upon the bodies of the<span class='pagenum'>227</span>
fallen, they stripped the dead, and dying. The night was
stormy. The moon, emerging from dark clouds, occasionally,
shed its pale lustre upon this horrible scene. When the plunderers
had abandoned their prey, during an interval of deep
darkness, in the dead of the night, when all was silent, unconscious
of each other's intentions, the two citizens who had
escaped the general carnage, disencumbered themselves from
the dead, under whom they were buried; chilled and naked,
in an agony of mind not to be described, they, at the same
moment, attempted to escape. In their agitation, they rushed
against each other. Expressions of terror and surprise, dropped
from each of them. "Oh! God! it is my father!" said one,
"my son, my son, my son," exclaimed the other, clasping
him in his arms. They were father and son, who had thus
miraculously escaped, and met in this extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>The person from whom I received this account, informed
me, that he knew these gentlemen very well, and that they
had been resettled in Toulon about two years.</p>

<p>The wretch who had thus directed the ruthless vengeance
of a revolutionary banditti, against the breasts of his fellow
citizens, was, at this time, in Paris, soliciting, from the present
government, from a total misconception of its nature, those
remunerations which had been promised, but never realized by
his barbarous employers.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add, that although he had been in the capital
several months, he had not been able to gain access to
the minister's secretary.</p>

<p>The time of terror was over&mdash;the murderer's occupation was<span class='pagenum'>228</span>
gone&mdash;the guillotine, with unsatiated hunger, after having
gorged the food which was thrown to it, had devoured its feeder.</p>

<p>I must leave it to the ingenuity of my reader, to connect
the observation with which I shall close this chapter, with
the preceding story, for I am only enabled to do so, by observing,
that an impressive instance of the subject of it, occurred
immediately after my mind had been harrowed up,
by the narrative which I have just related. The married women
of France feel no compunctious visitings of conscience, in
cherishing about them a circle of lovers, amongst whom their
husbands are <i>merely</i> more favoured than the rest. I hope I
shall not be considered as an apologist, for an indulgence
which, in France, excites no jealousy in <i>one</i>, and no surprise
amongst the many, when I declare, that I confidently believe,
in most instances, it commences, and guiltlessly terminates in
the love of admiration. I know, and visited in Paris, a most
lovely and accomplished young woman, who had been married
about two years. She admitted the visits of men, whom she
knew were passionately fond of her. Sometimes she received
them in the presence, and sometimes in the absence of her
husband, as accident, not arrangement, directed. They approached
her with all the agitation and tenderness of the most
ardent lovers. Amongst the number, was a certain celebrated
orator. This man was her abject slave. A glance from her
expressive eye raised him to the summit of bliss, or rendered
his night sleepless. The complacent husband of Madame G&mdash;&mdash;
regarded these men as his most beloved friends, because they
enlarged the happiness of his wife; and, strange as it may<span class='pagenum'>229</span>
appear, I believe that he had as little cause to complain as
Othello, and therefore never permitted his repose to be disturbed
by those suspicions which preyed upon the vitals of the
hapless moor. The french Benedict might truly exclaim,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'Tis not to make me jealous,</span>
<span class="i0">To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</span>
<span class="i0">Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</span>
<span class="i0">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor from my own weak merits will I draw</span>
<span class="i0">The smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt."</span>
<span class='pagenum'>230</span></div></div>

<p>I visited, one evening, a very beautiful exhibition, which
I think worthy of being noticed; it was the picturesque and
mechanical theatre. The company present were select and
genteel. The room and stage were upon a small scale; the
former was very elegantly fitted up. The spectacle consisted
of scenery and appropriate little moving figures. The first scene
was a view of a wood in early morning, every object looked
blue, fresh, and dewy. The gradations of light, until the
approach of meridian day, were admirably represented. Serpents
were seen crawling in the grass. A little sportsman entered
with his fowling-piece, and imitated all the movements natural
to his pursuit; a tiny wild duck rose from a lake, and
flew before him. He pointed his gun, changed his situation,
pointed it again, and fired. The bird dropped; he threw it
over his shoulders, fastened to his gun, and retired. Waggons,
drawn by horses about four inches high, passed along; groups
of peasantry followed, exquisitely imitating all the indications
of life. Amongst several other scenes was a beautiful view
of the bay of Naples, and the great bridge; over which little<span class='pagenum'>231</span>
horses, with their riders, passed in the various paces of walking,
trotting and galloping. All the minuti&aelig; of nature were attended
to. The ear was beguiled with the patting of the horses'
hoofs upon the pavement; and some of the little animals
reared, and ran before the others. There were also some
charming little sea-pieces, in which the vessels sailed with their
heads towards the spectators, and man&#339;uvred in a surprising
manner. The whole concluded with a storm and shipwreck.
Sailors were seen floating in the water, then sinking in the
surge. One of them rose again and reached a rock. Boats
put off to his relief, and perished in the attempt. The little
figure was seen displaying the greatest agonies. The storm
subsided; tiny persons appeared upon the top of a projecting
cliff, near a watch tower, and lowered a rope to the little
sufferer below, which he caught, and, after ascending to some
height by it, overwhelmed with fatigue, lost his hold. After
recovering from the fall, he renewed his efforts, and at length
reached the top in safety, amidst the acclamations of the spectators,
who, moved by this enchanting little illusion, took much
interest in the apparent distress of the scene.</p>

<p>Upon quitting the theatre, we found a real storm without.
The lightning flamed upon us from every quarter, and was
succeeded by loud peals of thunder. Whilst we were contemplating
the tempest from the balcony of Madame S&mdash;&mdash;,
a ball of fire fell very near us, and filled the room with a
sulphureous stench. A servant soon afterwards entered, almost
breathless, to inform his mistress, Madame R&mdash;&mdash;, who was
of the party, that the fire-ball had penetrated her house, which<span class='pagenum'>232</span>
was close adjoining, without having effected any injury.
Madame R&mdash;&mdash; laughed heartily, and observed, "Well, it is
very droll that the lightning should make so free with my
house when I am not at home." This little sprightly remark
dispersed the gloom which had overshadowed most of
the ladies present. All the large houses in Paris are well protected
against the perilous effect of electric fluid, by conductors,
which are very judiciously disposed.</p>

<p>An invention has lately made its appearance in Paris, which
is as full of utility as it is of genius. A house has been lately
opened for the sale of filtrating and purifying vases, to which
the ingenious constructor has given the most elegant etruscan
shapes. They are capable of refining the most fetid and corrupt
water, by a process which, in its operation, lasts about four
minutes. The principle is the same as in nature. The foul
water is thrown into the vase, where it passes through various
strata of earth, which are compressed in a series of little apartments,
which retain its offensive particles, and from which it
issues as clear and as sweet as rock water. This discovery
will prove of infinite consequence to families who reside in
the maritime parts of Holland, and to many inland towns in
France, where the water is frequently very bad. I most cordially
hope that the inventor will meet with the remuneration
which is due to his humane philosophy.</p>

<p>After having experienced a most cordial display of kindnesses
and hospitalities, I prepared to return to my own country,
"that precious stone set in the silver sea." I had to part with
those who, in the short space of one fleeting month, had, by<span class='pagenum'>233</span>
their endearing and flattering attentions, rivetted themselves to
my affections, with the force of a long, and frequent, and
cherished intercourse, who, in a country where I expected
to feel the comfortless sensations of a foreigner, made me forget
that I was even a <i>stranger</i>. Amongst those who excited a considerable
share of my regret upon parting, were the elegant
and charming family of the S&mdash;&mdash;s. As I was preparing to take
my leave, Madame S&mdash;&mdash; said, "You must not forget us because
a few waves divide our countries."</p>

<p>"If he will lend me his pocket-book," said one of her lovely
daughters, "I will try and see if my pencil will not preserve
us in his memory, at least for a little time."</p>

<p>I presented it to her, and in a few minutes she made an
elegant little sketch, which she called "The affectionate
Mother." Amiable young artist! may Time, propitious to the
happiness of some generous being, who is worthy of such an
associate, hail thee with the blissful appellation! and may the
graceful discharge of those refined and affecting duties which
flow from connubial love, entitle thee, too much esteemed
to be envied, to the name of the modern Cornelia!</p>

<p>Several Englishmen, whilst I was at Paris, met with very
vexatious delays in procuring their passports to enable them
to leave it, from a mistaken course of application. Instead
of applying to M. Fouche, or any other municipal officer,
I would recommend them to procure their passport from their
own embassador, and send it to the office of Mons. Talleyrand
for his endorsement; by which means they will be enabled to
quit the republic in two or three days after their application.<span class='pagenum'>234</span></p>

<p>Having previously determined to return by the way of Lower
Normandy, upon the beauty and luxuriance of which I had
heard much eulogy, about half past five o'clock in the morning
of the 21st of Prairial, I left my hotel, and proceeded to the
Messagerie, from which the diligences, all of which are under
the control of the nation, set out. The morning was very
beautiful. I was much entertained before I mounted that
cumbrous vehicle, which was to roll me a little nearer to my
own coast, by viewing the numerous groups of travellers and
their friends, who surrounded the different carriages as the
horses were tackling to them. In different directions of my
eye, I saw about thirty men kissing each other. The women
in France never think their prerogatives infringed by this anti-anglo
mode of salutation. Some shed tears at parting; but
the cheek down which they trickled never lost its colour or
vivacity. All were animated; every eye looked bright; there
was a gayety in their very grief. "Bon voyage, bon voyage&mdash;Dieu
vous benisse, Dieu vous benisse," reiterated on all sides
from sprightly faces, stretched out of the window frames of the
massy machine, as it rattled through the gates of the yard, to
the incessant crackings of the postilion's long lash. I soon
afterwards found myself seated in the diligence for Cherbourg,
in company with two ladies, and three gentlemen, who were
all polite and pleasing. In the cabriole, forward, was a french
captain in the army, who had been in Tippoo's service at the
time of the surrender of Seringapatam. He looked abominably
dirty in his travelling habiliments; but that, in France, is now
no just indication of inferiority or vulgarity.<span class='pagenum'>235</span></p>

<p>We passed by the Place de la Concorde, upon the statues
and buildings of which, and the gardens of the Thuilleries,
the fresh and early sun shone most beautifully. My merry,
but feeling fellow travellers, waving their hands, addressed
a short apostrophe to these suburb objects, and exclaimed,
"adieu ma tres jolie ville&mdash;ah! tres jolie ville adieu."</p>

<p>For near three miles after leaving the barrier, we passed
through plantations of roses, which supply the markets of
Paris with that beautiful flower, which, transferred thence,
adorn the toilets, the vases, and the bosoms of the fair
parisians, and form the favourite bouquets of the petite maitres;
on each side of the road were cherry trees, in full bearing,
which presented a very charming appearance. We soon
reached the water works of Marli, which supply the jets d'eau
of Versailles. They are upon a vast scale, and appear to be
very curious. A little further on we passed Mal Maison, the
country, and chief residence of the first consul and his family.
It is an ancient house, embosomed in beautiful woods and
gardens. At the entrance are large military lodges, for the
accommodation of a squadron of the consular cavalry, who
mount guard when their general is here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image10.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="Malmaison." title="Malmaison." />
<span class="caption"><a name="Malmaison" id="Malmaison"></a>Malmaison.</span>
</div>

<p>At St. Germain's we breakfasted, upon pork cutlets, excellent
bread, wine, and cherries, for twenty sols, or ten pence
english. At Mante we had an excellent dinner, of several
dishes, for thirty sols, or one shilling and three pence english.
Soon after we had passed Mante, we left the higher norman
road, and entered a country extremely picturesque and rich.
We were conducted through the forest of Evreux, by an escort<span class='pagenum'>236</span>
of chasseurs. This vast tract of land is infested by an immense
banditti, who live in large excavations in the earth, similar
to the subterranean apartments of the celebrated robbers, in
whose service Gil Blas was rather reluctantly enrolled, and
generally assail the traveller, with a force which would render
common resistance perilous, and unavailing. This forest, in
the course of the year, furnishes considerable employ for the
guillotine of Caen, where the tribunal of justice is seated.
The appearance of our guards was terrific enough to appal
such valiant souls, as once animated the frames of <i>prince Hal</i>,
and his merry friend <i>Ned Poins</i>. They wore roman helmets,
from which descended, to the bottom of their backs, an immense
tail, of thick black horsehair, their uniform was light
green, and looked rather shabby.</p>

<p>We passed the forest without any molestation, and supped
at the town of Evreux, which is very pleasant, where we halted
for about four hours. As we were afterwards proceeding, I
prepared myself to enjoy a little sleep, and as I reclined for
this purpose with my hat over my face, in a corner of the
carriage, I overheard one of my fellow travellers observe to
the other, "the englishman is sleeping," to which he replied,
"no, he is not sleeping, he is only thinking, it is the character
of his nation."</p>

<p>The french cannot bear the least appearance of thought;
they have a saying, "un homme qui rit ne sera jamais dangereux."</p>

<p>The next morning we breakfasted at Lisieux, an ancient
town, in which are the remains of a fine convent, which for<span class='pagenum'>237</span>merly
belonged to the Order of the Capuchins. For four or
five miles before we approached the town, the laughing and
animated faces of groups of peasantry, all in their jubilee
dresses, the old mounted upon asses, and the young walking
by the sides of them, hastening to the town, announced to us,
that a fair, and merry making was to be held there, on that
day. Lisieux was quite in a bustle. About six o'clock in the
evening of the same day, we arrived at Caen, the capital
of Lower Normandy. My fare to this city from Paris,
amounted to thirty livres, including my luggage. I had not
completed my dinner at the H&ocirc;tel de la Place, before an
english servant entered my room, to inform me, that his
mistress, Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, who, with her daughters, and another
young lady, had the rooms over mine, presented her compliments
to me, and requested me to take my coffee with
them that evening. I must confess I was at first a little
surprised at the message, for the english are not very remarkable
for politeness and attention to one another in a
foreign country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image11.jpg" width="600" height="451" alt="Caen." title="Caen." />
<span class="caption"><a name="Caen" id="Caen"></a>Caen.</span>
</div>

<p>After I had finished my desert, I made my bow to Mrs.
P&mdash;&mdash;, and her family, who proved to be very pleasant, and
accomplished people, and were making the tour of France
with english servants. They had been in Caen near three
weeks, where they had a large acquaintance of the first respectability.
This unexpected introduction became additionally
agreeable, upon my discovery at the Messagerie, that the diligence
for Cherbourg would not proceed, till three days from
the time of my arrival. The next morning I rambled with<span class='pagenum'>238</span>
my new friends about the city, which is large, and handsome,
and is watered by the river Orne. It is much celebrated
for its lace trade; on that day I dined with Mrs.
P&mdash;&mdash;, and a french party, and was regaled with an english
dinner, cooked, and served up by her own servants. The
filth of the french kitchen is too well known, to make it
necessary for me to say how delicious such a dinner was.
The french admit themselves that their cooks are destitute of
cleanliness.</p>

<p>The Convent of the Benedictines, which is converted into
the palace of the prefect, is a noble building. The gardens
belonging to it are well arranged. The promenade called de
la Cour is very charming, from which the city is seen to
great advantage. The water of the Orne is rather nauseous,
but is not considered unwholesome. The Palais de Justice
is a fine modern structure. In its courts of law, I had again
an opportunity of hearing the forensic elocution of Normandy.
The gestures, and vehemence of the orators here,
as at Rouen, appeared to me to be tinctured with the extravagance
of frenzy. But perhaps my ears, and eyes have
been rendered somewhat too fastidious by having been frequently
banqueted with the grace, animation, and commanding
eloquence of the unrivalled advocate of the british bar;
who, when he retires from the laborious duties of the
crowded, and admiring forum, where his acute sagacity has
so often unfolded the dark compact involutions of human
obliquity, where his wit and fancy have covered with the
choicest flowers, the dreary barrenness of technical pleading;<span class='pagenum'>239</span>
will leave behind him that lasting, and honourable respect
and remembrance, which faculties so extensively beneficial,
must ever excite in the minds of men who have been instructed,
delighted, and benefited by their splendid, and prosperous
display.</p>

<p>In this city was pointed out to me, the house in which
the celebrated Charlotte Corday resided, who, by her poniard,
delivered France of the monster, Marat, on Sunday, the
14th of July, 1793. There is some coincidence in the
crimes, and fate of Caligula and Marat, both perished by
the avengers of their country, whilst in the act of approaching
their baths. Posterity will embalm, with its grateful remembrance,
the patriotic heroism of this great, and distinguished
female, and in her own firm, and eloquent language,
will say of her, "that crime begets disgrace, and not
the scaffold."</p>

<p>On the evening after my arrival at Caen, I was invited
to an elegant ball, which was given by the lady of the
paymaster general of the district, in one of the government
houses. I had before witnessed the dancing of the higher
orders of people in Paris, and from this reason was not surprised
in contemplating the exquisite grace which was here
displayed. The party consisted of near eighty persons.
Amongst them were the judges of the district, and the principal
officers quartered in the city, and its neighbourhood,
the latter were attired in superb military dresses. Amongst
the ladies were several beautiful, well dressed young women,
who exhibited their persons to great advantage. The grave,<span class='pagenum'>240</span>
and elderly part of the company played at buillotte, which
is at present the favourite french game. In France to please
and to be pleased, seem to be the two presiding principles
in all their meetings. An elegant young officer, who had
distinguished himself at the battle of Marengo, observing that
the musicians appeared to be a little fatigued, by the contribution
of their exhilarating services towards the festivity of
the evening, supplied their room, whilst they refreshed themselves,
and struck up an english country dance on one of
the violins. The party attempted to dance it, but to show
how arbitrary habit is, in the attempt, all those powers of
grace, which they had before so beautifully displayed, retired
as if influenced by the magic of some unpropitious spirit.
Amongst the party, was a little girl, about nine years old,
who was dressed in the highest style of fashion, and looked
like a fashionable milliner's doll. This little spoiled child
was accustomed to spend an hour at her toilette every
morning, and to be tricked out in all the ephemeral decoration
of the haut ton. This little coquette already looked
out for admiration, and its foolish mother expressed the
greatest satisfaction, when any one, out of politeness to her,
paid attentions to the pert premature nursling. Our entertainment
concluded with a handsome supper, and we parted,
highly delighted, at the dawn of day. Nothing could be
more flattering, than the attentions which, as an englishman,
I received from every one present.</p>

<p>After a few hours repose, I went with a large party to
the church of Notre Dame; in which there is a very fine<span class='pagenum'>241</span>
altar piece. The keeper of the sachristy, who was a very
arch-looking little fellow, in spite of the solemnity of the
place in which we were, made us all smile (even a young
lady who was going to be confessed for the first time the
next day, lost a considerable proportion of her gravity) by
informing us, that during the time of terror he had run off
with the Virgin Mary, pointing to the image, and that to
prevent the detection of Robespierre's agents, he had concealed
her in his bed for three years. Nothing could exceed
his joy in having saved her from the hatchet, or the flames,
from which impending fate, she was restored to her former
situation in this church; and was, when we saw her, by
the extravagance of her sprightly, and ardent protector,
dressed in a white muslin gown, spotted with silver; a little
bouquet of artificial flowers graced her bosom, and her wig
was finely curled, and powdered. The figure in her arms,
which was intended to represent the infant Jesus, was dressed
in a style equally unsuitable; his hair was also curled, and
powdered, and a small cocked hat placed upon his head.
Our delighted guide, whose eyes sparkled with self-complacency,
asked us if we had ever seen a prettier Virgin Mary,
or one dressed more handsomely. We were all much amused
by the quaintness of this man's conduct, although I am confident
he had no intention of exciting unbecoming sensations,
for in saving this image, he had exposed his life.</p>

<p>From Notre Dame, we went to the Abbaye aux Hommes,
built by William the Conqueror. It is a large lofty plain
pile of building. The spires are well proportioned, and very<span class='pagenum'>242</span>
high. The pillars in the choir are, in my humble opinion,
too massy. Preparations were here making for the celebration
of the great festival called the Feast of God. We presented
to one of the priests, who, in the sachristy, was
adorning the cradle of our Saviour's image with flowers,
some very fine moss roses, which in France are very rare,
which he received with great politeness. This festival before
the revolution was always superbly celebrated. It was then
renewed for the first time since the proscription of religion,
during which, all the costly habits of the priests, and rich
vessels used in the ceremonies of the church have been
stolen, sold, or melted down. Near the altar, which has
been shattered by the axe of the revolution, is the vault of
the norman conqueror.</p>

<p>Upon our return to our hotel, we saw a considerable
crowd assembled near the bridge leading to de la Cour.
Upon inquiring into the cause of this assemblage, we
found it was owing to a curious rencounter between two
blind beggars, who, in total darkness, had been waging an
uncertain battle for near six minutes. It appeared that one
of them had for several months, enjoyed quiet possession of
the bridge, which happened to be a great thoroughfare, and
had during that time, by an undisputed display of his calamity,
contrived to pick up a comfortable recompense for
it; that within a few days preceding this novel fracas, another
mendicant, who had equal claims to compassion, allured
by the repute of his success, had deserted a less frequented
part of the city, and had presented himself at the other<span class='pagenum'>243</span>
corner of the same bridge, where by a more masterly selection
of moving phrases, he soon not only divided, but
monopolized the eleemosynary revenues of this post of wretchedness.
The original possessor naturally grew jealous. Even
beggars "can bear no brother near the throne." Inflamed
with jealousy, he silently moved towards his rival, by the
sound of whose voice, which was then sending forth some
of its most affecting, and purse-drawing strains, he was enabled
to determine whether his arm was within reach of the head
of his competitor, which circumstance, having with due
nicety ascertained, he clenched his fist, which in weight,
size, and firmness, was not much surpassed by the hard,
and ponderous paw of a full-grown tiger, and with all the
force of that propulsion, which a formidable set of muscles
afforded, he felled his rival to the ground, and not knowing
that he was fallen, discharged many other blows, which
only served to disturb the tranquillity of the air. The recumbent
hero, whose head was framed for enterprises of this
nature, soon recovered from the assault, and, after many unavailing
efforts in the dark, at length succeeded in opening
one of the vessels of the broad nose of his brawny assailant,
whose blood, enriched by good living, streamed out most
copiously. In this condition we saw these orbless combatants,
who were speedily separated from each other. Some of the
crowd were endeavouring to form a treaty of pacification
between them, whether they succeeded I know not, for we
were obliged to leave the bridge of battle, before these important
points were arranged, to join a pleasant party at<span class='pagenum'>244</span>
Mons. St. J&mdash;&mdash;'s, an opulent banker at Caen, to whom I
had letters of introduction from Mons. R&mdash;&mdash;, the banker
of Paris.</p>

<p>After spending the short time, during which I was detained
at Caen, very pleasantly, I resumed my seat in the
diligence for Cherbourg, in which I found a very agreeable
woman, her two daughters, two canary birds, a cat, and
her kitten, who were, I found, to be my companions all
the way. After we left Caen, the roads became very bad.
Our ponderous machine, frequently rolled from one side to
the other, and with many alarming creakings, threatened us
with a heavy, and perilous overthrow. At length we arrived
at Bayeux, where we dined, at the house of a friend
of my fair fellow traveller, to which she invited me with a
tone of welcome, and good wishes, which overpowered all
resistance. We sat down to an excellent dinner, at which
was produced the usual favourite french dish of cold turbot,
and raw artichokes. After our repast, a fine young woman,
the daughter of the lady of the house, in a very obliging,
but rather grave manner, poured out a tumbler full of some
delicious potent liqueur, which, to my no small surprise,
she presented me with; upon my only tasting it, and returning
it, she appeared to be equally surprised, and confused.
Her mother, observing our mutual embarrassment, informed
me, that in France it was understood that the english
were troubled with the ennui, or tristesse de c&#339;ur, and
that they drank large draughts of wine and spirits to expel
the gloomy malady. I softened this opinion of our com<span class='pagenum'>245</span>mon
character, as well as I could, for, I fear, without offering
considerable outrage to truth, I could not wholly have
denied it.</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked to the cathedral, which is a noble
gothic pile, and, upon our return, found the diligence in
waiting for us. My companions were attended to the door
of the carriage by their hospitable friends, between whom several
kisses were interchanged. I took an opportunity, just before
I mounted the step, of stealing one of these tokens of regard
from the fair young damsel who had so courteously offered me
the liqueur, at the same time telling her, that in England, a kiss
was always considered as the best remedy for the tristesse de
c&#339;ur.&mdash;Away trotted our little norman steeds; and, notwithstanding
they had come all the way from Caen, they soon carried
us over the hills on this side of Bayeux. The eye communicated
delight to the heart, whilst it contemplated the vast
extent of corn fields, which in this fertile province undulated on
all sides of us, in waves of yellow exuberance, over which, embosomed
in trees, at short distances, peeped the peaceful and
picturesque abode of the prosperous cottage farmer. The prospect
afforded an impressive contrast to the impolitic agricultural
system, which has lately obtained in England, by which cottage
farms are consolidated into ample domains of monopoly, and
a baneful preference is given in favour of the rearing of cattle,
to the vital and bountiful labours of the plough. A celebrated
writer, who well knew in what the real wealth of a nation
consisted, has observed, that he who could make two ears
of corn grow upon a spot of ground, where only one grew<span class='pagenum'>246</span>
before, would deserve better of mankind than the whole race
of politicians. The high roads of Normandy are unnecessarily
broad; hence considerable portions of land remain uncultivated.
A spacious road, like every thing which is vast, excites an impression
of grandeur; but in this prolific department, the facilities
of travelling, and the dignity of the country, might be
consulted with less waste. This prodigality is perhaps attributable
to the highways in France having shared but little of its
legislative attention; and accommodation appears to have been
sought rather by a lavish allotment of space, than by a judicious
formation, and frequent repair.</p>

<p>The inns along the road are very poor, although over the door
of almost every little cottage is written, in large characters,
"Bon Cidre de Victoire." There are also no regular post-horses
to be met with. The country, on all sides of us, was
very mountainous and luxuriant, and much resembled the
southern parts of Devonshire. About seven o'clock in the
evening of the same day, we arrived at St. Lo, which is, without
exception, the cleanest and most charming, romantic little town,
I saw in France. It is fortified, and stands upon the top of
a mountain, at whose base is expanded a luxuriant scenery of
woods and villages, through which the riviere de Ville winds
in beautiful meanders. The inhabitants of this town appeared
to be rich and genteel. In the evening I supped at the table
d'h&ocirc;te, where there were several pleasant people. At this town
we slept, and set off, the next morning, very early, for Valogne,
where we dined; and in the evening, after passing a considerable
extent of rich meadow land, and descending a very<span class='pagenum'>247</span>
steep hill, the freshness of the sea air announced to us our near
approach to Cherbourg, where, at the h&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre, I was
soon afterwards landed. For my place and luggage to this
place I paid twenty-four livres. My expenses upon the road
were very reasonable. Here I had the good fortune to find
a packet which intended to sail to England in two days, the
master of which asked me only one guinea for my passage in
the cabin, provisions included. However, thinking that the
kitchen of a french vessel might, if possible, be more uncleanly
than the kitchen of a french inn, I resolved upon providing
my own refreshments for the little voyage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image12.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="Cherbourg" title="Cherbourg" />
<span class="caption"><a name="Cherbourg" id="Cherbourg"></a>Cherbourg</span>
</div>

<p>Cherbourg is a poor and dirty town. After having heard so
much of its costly works and fortifications for the protection
of its harbour, my surprise was not little, upon finding the
place so miserable. It is defended by three great forts, which
are erected upon rocks in the sea. The centre one is about
three miles off from shore, and is garrisoned by 1200 men. At
a distance, this fort looks like a vast floating battery. Upon a line
with it, but divided by a distance sufficient for the admission
of shipping, commences the celebrated, stupendous wall, which
has been erected since the failure of the cones. It is just
visible at low water. This surprising work is six miles in
length, and three hundred french feet in breadth, and is composed
of massy stones and masonry, which have been sunk for the
purpose, and which are now cemented, by sea weed, their own
weight and cohesion, into one immense mass of rock. Upon
this wall a chain of forts is intended to be erected, as soon as
the finances of government will admit of it. The expenses<span class='pagenum'>248</span>
which have already been incurred, in constructing this wonderful
fabric, have, it is said, exceeded two millions sterling.
These costly protective barriers can only be considered as so
many monuments, erected by the french to the superior genius
and prowess of the british navy.</p>

<p>Whilst I was waiting for the packet's sailing, I received
great civilities from Mons. C&mdash;&mdash;, the banker and american
consul at Cherbourg, to whom I had letters from Mons. R&mdash;&mdash;.
I rode, the second evening after my arrival, to his country
house, which was about nine miles from the town. Our road
to it lay over a prolific and mountainous country. From a high
point of land, as we passed along, we saw the islands of
Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney, which made a beautiful appearance
upon the sea. Upon our return, by another road,
I was much pleased with a group of little cottages, which were
embosomed in a beautiful wood, through which there was an
opening to the sea, which the sinking sun had then overspread
with the richest lustre. As we entered this scene of rustic repose,
the angelus bell of the little village church rang; and a short
time afterwards, as we approached it, a number of villagers came
out from the porch, with their mass-books in their hands, their
countenances beaming with happiness and illuminated by
the sinking sun, which shone full upon them. The charms
of this simple scene arrested our progress for a short time.
Under some spreading limes, upon a sloping lawn, the cheerful
cottagers closed the evening with dancing to the sounds of
one of the sweetest flagelets I ever heard, which was alternately
played by several performers, who relieved each other. In<span class='pagenum'>249</span>
France, every man is a musician. Goldsmith's charming picture
of his Auburn, in its happier times, recurred to me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When toil remitting, lends its turn to play,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the village train, from labour free,</span>
<span class="i0">Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The cross roads of France are very bad; but, to my surprise,
although we never could have had a worse specimen of them
than what this excursion presented to us, yet the norman hunter
upon which I was mounted, carried me over the deepest ruts,
and abrupt hillocks, without showing the least symptom of
infirmity which so much prevails amongst his brethren of the
Devonshire breed. The norman horses are remarkable for lifting
their feet high, and the safety and ease with which they
carry their riders. In the morning of the day in which the
packet was to sail, a favourable breeze sprung up; and, after
undergoing the usual search of the revenue officers, in the
execution of which they behaved with much civility, I embarked,
and bade adieu to continental ground. The vessel had
the appearance of being freighted with hot bread, with which
the deck was covered from one end to the other. This immense
collection of smoking loaves was intended for the supply
of six men, and one woman, during a passage which we expected
to accomplish in thirty hours, or less!</p>

<p>The faithful associate of our young captain, to whom she had
just been married, either from motives of fondness or distrust,
resolved upon sharing with him the perils of the ocean.<span class='pagenum'>250</span></p>

<p>The sea-sufferings of this constant creature, and the resignation
with which she endured them, sufficiently manifested
the strength of her affections; for she was obliged to keep below
all the time, and could afford but very little assistance in reducing
the prodigious depot of bread which we had on board.</p>

<p>Credulous mariners describe a species of the fair sex (I believe
the only one) who appear to much advantage upon the briny
wave; but the nature of our commander's lady not happening
to be amphibious, she gave such unequivocal proofs of being out
of her proper element, that my wishes for shore increased
upon me every minute.</p>

<p>During our passage, I could not help contrasting the habits
of the english with the french sailors. The british tar thinks his
allowance of salt beef scarcely digestible without a copious
libation of ardent spirits, whilst the gallic mariner is satisfied with
a little meagre soup, an immoderate share of bread, and a
beverage of water, poor cider, or spiritless wine.</p>

<p>At length, after a passage of a day and a night, in which
we experienced the vicissitudes of a stiff breeze, and a dead
calm, we beheld</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"That pale, that white-fac'd shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides,</span>
<span class="i0">And coops from other lands her islanders,</span>
<span class="i0">That water-walled bulwark, still secure</span>
<span class="i0">And confident from foreign purposes."</span>
</div></div>

<p>After passing another tedious night on board, owing to our
being becalmed within the Needles, I stepped upon the same<span class='pagenum'>251</span>
landing stone from which I first embarked for a country, where,
in the centre of proscriptions, instability and desolation, those
arts which are said to flourish only in the regions of repose,
have, by their vigour and unrivalled bloom, excited the wonder
and admiration of surrounding nations; where Peace, by her
sudden and cherished reappearance, is calling forth all the
virtues from their hiding places, to aid in effacing the corroding
stains of a barbarous revolution, and in restoring the moral and
social character to its pristine polish, rank and estimation.<span class='pagenum'>252</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS" id="GENERAL_REMARKS"></a>GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>


<p>The fact seems at first singular. Two of the greatest nations
under Heaven, whose shores almost touch, and, if ancient
tales be true, were once unsevered, call the natives of
each other foreigners.</p>

<p>Jealousy, competition, and consequent warfare, have, for
ages, produced an artificial distance and separation, much
wider, and more impassable, than nature ever intended, by
the division which she has framed; hence, whilst the unassisted
eye of the islander can, from his own shores, with
"unwet feet," behold the natural barrier of his continental
neighbour, he knows but little more of his real character
and habits, than of those of beings, who are more distantly
removed from him, by many degrees of the great circle.</p>

<p>The events which have happened in France for the last
eleven years, have rendered this separation more severe, and
during that long and gloomy interval, have wholly changed
the national character. Those who once occupied the higher
class in the ascending scale of society, and who have survived
the revolution without leaving their country, are no
longer able to display the taste and munificence which once
distinguished them. In the capital, those who formerly were
accustomed to have their court yards nightly filled with
carriages, and their staircases lined with lacqueys, are now
scarcely able to occupy one third of their noble abodes. They
cannot even enjoy the common observances of friendship,<span class='pagenum'>253</span>
and hospitality, without pausing, and resorting to calculation.
A new race of beings called the "nouveaux enrich&eacute;s," whose
services have been chiefly auxiliary to the war, at present
absorb the visible wealth of the nation. Amongst them are
many respectable persons. The lower orders of the people have
been taught, by restless visionaries, to consider the destinations
of Providence, which had before, by an imperceptible gradation
of social colouring, united the russet brown to the magisterial
purple, as usurpations over those natural rights which
have been impressed without illustration, and magnified by a
mischievous mystery. In the fierce pursuit of these imaginary
immunities, which they had been taught to believe had been
long withheld, they abruptly renounced all deference and
decorum, as perilous indications of the fallacy of their indefinable
pretensions, and were not a little encouraged by the
disastrous desertion of their superiors, who fled at the first
alarm. In short, the revolution has, in general, made the
higher orders poor, and dispirited, and the lower barbarous,
and insolent, whilst a third class has sprung up, with the silence
and suddenness of an exhalation, higher than both, without
participating in the original character of either, in which the
principles of computation, and the vanity of wealth, are at
awkward variance.</p>

<p>Until lately, the ancient french and the modern french
were antipodes, but they are now converging, under a government,
which, in point of security, and even of mildness,
has no resemblance, since the first departure from the ancient
establishments. The french, like the libertine son, after having<span class='pagenum'>254</span>
plunged in riot and excesses, subdued by wretchedness, are
returning to order and civilization. Unhappy people, their
tears have almost washed away their offences&mdash;they have suffered
to their heart's core. Who will not pity them to see their
change, and hear their tales of misery? Yet, strange to relate,
in the midst of their sighs and sufferings, they recount, with
enthusiasm, the exploits of those very men, whose heroic
ambition has trampled upon their best hopes, and proudest
prosperity. Dazzled by the brilliancy of the spreading flame,
they forget that their own abode is involved in its desolation,
and augments the gloomy grandeur of the scene. To this
cause may, perhaps, be traced that singular union of grief
and gayety, which affords rather an impressive contrast to the
more solemn consistency of english sadness. The terrible experiment
which they have tried, has, throughout, presented a
ferocious contest for power, which has only served to deteriorate
their condition, sap their vigour, and render them too
feeble either to continue the contest, or to reach the frontier
of their former character. In this condition they have been
found by a man who, with the precedent of history in one
hand, and the sabre in the other, has, unstained with the
crimes of Cromwell, possessed himself of the sovereignty; and,
like Augustus, without the propensities which shaded his early
life, preserved the <i>name</i> of a republic, whilst he well knows
that a decisive and irresistible authority can alone reunite a
people so vast and distracted; who, in the pursuit of a fatal
phantom, have been inured to change, and long alienated
from subordination. I would not wish such a government to<span class='pagenum'>255</span>
be perpetual, but if it be conducted with wisdom and justice, I
will not hesitate to declare, that I think it will ultimately
prove as favourable to the happiness, as it has been propitious
to the glory of the french. A government which breathes a
martial spirit under a thin appearance of civil polity, presents
but a barren subject to the consideration of the inquirer.
When the sabre is changed into the sceptre, the science of
legislation is short, simple, and decisive. Its energies are neither
entangled in abstract distinctions, nor much impeded by
the accustomed delays of deliberation.</p>

<p>From the magnitude of the present ruling establishment
in France, and the judicious distribution of its powers, and
confidence, the physical strength can scarcely be said to reside
in the <i>governed</i>.</p>

<p>A great portion of the population participates in the character
of the government. The bayonet is perpetually flashing
before the eye. The remark may appear a little ludicrous,
but in the capital almost every man who is not <i>near
sighted</i> is a soldier, and every soldier of the republic considers
himself as a subordinate minister of state. In short the
whole political fabric is a refined system of knight's service.
Seven centuries are rolled back, and from the gloom of time
behold the crested spirit of the norman hero advance, "with
beaver up," and nod his sable plumes, in grim approval
of the novel, gay, and gaudy feodality.</p>

<p>If such an expectation may be entertained, that time will
replace the ancient family on the throne, I am far from
believing that it can offer much consolation to the illustrious<span class='pagenum'>256</span>
wanderer, who as yet, has only tasted of the name of sovereignty.
If the old royalty is ever restored, it is my opinion,
and I offer it with becoming deference, that, from
personal hatred to the present titular monarch, and the dread
of retaliation by a lineal revival of monarchy, the crown
will be placed upon the brows of one of the <i>collateral</i>
branches of the expatriated family. The prince de Cond&eacute; is
the only member of that august house, of whom the french
speak with esteem, and approbation.</p>

<p>The treasury of the french is, as may be expected, not
overflowing, but its resources must speedily become ample.
The necessities of the state, or rather the peculations of its
former factious leaders, addressed themselves immediately to
the purses of the people, by a summary process completely
predatory. Circuitous exaction has been, till lately, long discarded.
The present rulers have not yet had sufficient time
to digest, and perfect a financial system, by which the establishments
of the country may be supported by indirect, and
unoffending taxation. Wisdom and genius must long, and
ardently labour, before the ruins, and rubbish of the revolution
can be removed. Every effort hitherto made to raise
the deciduous credit of the republic has been masterly, and
forcibly bespeaks the public hope, and confidence in favour
of every future measure.</p>

<p>The armies of the republic are immense; they have hitherto
been paid, and maintained by the countries which they have
subdued; their exigencies, unless they are employed, will in future
form an embarrassing subject of consideration in the ap<span class='pagenum'>257</span>proaching
system of finance. This mighty body of men, who
are very moderately paid, are united by the remembrance of
their glory, and the proud consideration that they constitute
a powerful part of the government; an impression which every
french soldier cherishes. They also derive some pride, even
from their discipline: a military delinquent is not subject to
ignoble punishment; if he offend, he suffers as a soldier.
Imprisonment, or death, alone displaces him from the ranks.
He is not cut down fainting, and covered with the ignominious
wounds of the dissecting scourge, and sent to languish
in the reeking wards of hospitals.</p>

<p>In reviewing the present condition of France, the liberal
mind will contemplate many events with pleasure, and will
suspend its final judgment, until wisdom, and genius shall
repose from their labours, and shall proclaim to the people,
"behold the work is done."</p>

<p>It has been observed, that in reviewing the late war, two
of the precepts of the celebrated author of "The Prince,"
will hereafter be enshrined in the judgments of politicians,
and will be as closely adhered to, as they have been boldly
disregarded by that great man, who, till lately, has long presided
over the british councils. Machiavel has asserted, that
no country ought to declare war with a nation which, at the
time, is in a state of internal commotion; and that, in the
prosecution of a war, the refugees of a belligerent power
ought not to be confidentially trusted by the opposite nation
which receives them. Upon violating the former, those heterogeneous
parties, which, if left to themselves, will always<span class='pagenum'>258</span>
embarrass the operations of their government, become united by
a common cause; and by offending against the latter clause of
this cautionary code, a perilous confidence is placed in the
triumph of gratitude, and private pique, over that great love
which nature plants and warmly cherishes in the breast of every
man, for his country. In extenuation of a departure from these
political maxims it may be urged, that the french excited
the war, and that in the pursuit of it, they displayed a <i>compound</i>
spirit, which Machiavel might well think problematical,
for whilst that country never averted its eye from the
common enemy, it never ceased to groan under the inflictions
of unremitting factions. Rather less can be said in palliation
of the fatal confidence, which was placed by the english
government in some of the french emigrants. I have
mentioned these unhappy people in the aggregate, with the
respect which I think they deserve. To be protected, and
not to betray, was all that could in fairness, and with safety
be expected from them; it was hazarding too much to put
swords in their hands, and send them to their own shores to
plunge them in the breasts of their own countrymen: in such
an enterprise</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"The native hue of resolution</span>
<span class="i0">Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought."</span>
</div>

<p>The brave have not frequently wept over such a victim as
Sombrieul.</p>

<p>Whether the experiment of repelling those machinations<span class='pagenum'>259</span>
which warred against all established order, and all sanctioned
usage, by a novel, and unnatural opposition, is attributable
to any other cause, than that of a misjudging principle,
must be decided by Him, whose mighty hand suspended
the balance of the battle, and whose eye can, at a
glance, pierce through the labyrinth of human obliquity, however
compact, shaded, or concealed. If the late minister is chargeable
with a prolongation of the war, if he is responsible for
having misplaced his confidence, and if brave men have perished
by the fatal delusion, he will find some, if not ample
consolation, in reflecting, that by his vigilance, and vigour,
he has saved his country from the miseries of a revolutionary
frenzy, which has rendered, even our enemies, the objects of
our sympathy, and compassion.</p>

<p>Such is the narrowness of our nature, that we know not
how adequately to appreciate our preservation from an <i>intercepted</i>
evil: it is indistinctly seen, like a distant object. The
calamity must <i>touch</i> before its powers and magnitude can be
estimated. The flames of the neighbouring pile, must stop
at our very doors, before our gratitude becomes animated with
its highest energies. If Providence were to unfold to us all
the horrours which we have escaped; if all the blood which
would have followed the assassin's dagger were to roll in
reeking streams before us; if the full display of irreligion,
flight, massacre, confiscation, imprisonment and famine, which
would have graced a revolutionary triumph in these realms,
were to be unbarred to our view, how should we recoil from the
ghastly spectacle! With what emotions of admiration and esteem<span class='pagenum'>260</span>
should we bend before the man, whose illumined mind and
dignified resolution protected us from such fell perdition, and
confined the ravages of the "bellowing storm" within its own
barrier.</p>

<p>The dazzling and perilous claims of the Rights of Man in
the abstract, have had a long and ample discussion before the
sanguinary tribunals of another country; and the loud decree
of an indignant and insulted world has pronounced their eternal
doom. Other contests may arise; but the powers of a prophet
are not necessary to assert, that such rights will form no part
of their provocation.</p>

<p>In France, I was repeatedly asked my opinion of the probable
stability of the peace. The question was always addressed
in this rather curious shape: "Thank God, we have
peace! <i>Will your</i> country let us enjoy it?"&mdash;My answer was,
"You may be assured of it; for it will not cease to be prepared
for war."</p>

<p>Alas! the restless spirit of ambition seldom long delights in
repose. The peaceful virtues, under whose influence Nations
flourish and mankind rejoice, possess no lasting captivations for
the Hero. The draught of conquest maddens his brain, and excites
an insatiable thirst for fresh atchievements&mdash;He</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Looks into the clouds, scorning the base degrees</span>
<span class="i0">By which he did ascend"&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>May that extraordinary Being in whose hands the fate of millions
is deposited reverse the gloomy picture, and restore to a country<span class='pagenum'>261</span>
long wasted by revolutions, and warfare, and languishing in the
midst of the monuments of her glory, the benign blessings of
enduring tranquillity. But if this hope prove fruitless, if all the
countries of continental Europe are destined to be compressed
into one empire, if their devoted princes are doomed to adorn the
triumphs of the chief of that mighty republic, which now towers
above the surrounding nations of the earth, like the pyramid of
the desert, what have we to fear even though the ocean which
divides us should become the <i>soldiers</i> element?</p>

<p>When an enlightened frenchman is asked what he thinks of
his government, his answer is, "We want repose." For this
alone, a stranger to the recent occurrences of the world would
think he had toiled, just as valetudinarians take exercise for the
purpose of securing sleep. Even those who have profited of
eleven years of desolation, are ready to acknowledge that war
is not pastime, and that a familiarity with its horrours does not
lessen them. The soldier, drooping under the weight of booty,
pants for the refreshing shades of his native village, and for the
hour which is to restore him to his alienated family.</p>

<p>I am satisfied, that both in France and England, one desire
pervades all classes of people, that two nations, so brave, and
so worthy of reciprocal esteem, may at last grow wise and virtuous
enough to abstain from those ebullitions of furious hostility
which have stained so many centuries with blood.</p>

<p>Peace is the gem with which Europe has embellished her
fair but palpitating bosom; and may disappointment and dishonour
be the lot of that ambitious and impolitic being who
endeavours or who wishes to pluck it from her!</p>
